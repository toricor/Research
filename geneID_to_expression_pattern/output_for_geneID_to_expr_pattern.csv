In addition, a prominent signal was present in a symmetrical pair of neurons also located in the vicinity of the anterior pharyngeal bulb. With processes running toward the tip of the animals extreme anterior, this pair of neurons displays a typical feature of chemosensory neurons exposed to the environment through specialized structures in the cuticle.

In addition, a signal was visible in the body wall muscles around the worm mouth. The signal detected in the posterior region was considered autofluorescence (as visible in other animals).

Deletion of the predicted transmembrane domain led to secretion of the protein into the culture media. Immunostaining of the FLAG-tagged ABU-1expressing COS1 cells with anti-FLAG antibodies showed a diffuse reticular pattern that colocalized with the ER marker ribophorin I. These results suggest that ABU-1 encodes an integral membrane protein that is retained in the ER by its transmembrane domain. The secretion of transmembrane domain deleted ABU-1 suggests that the lumenal portion of the protein folds properly in mammalian cells and that the full-length ABU-1 is unlikely to be retained in the ER as a consequence of malfolding in mammalian cells."

By using the acr-2 promoter to drive expression of SNB-1::CFP in cholinergic VA and VB motor neurons, CAM-1::YFP expression in cholinergic motor neurons was, in general, more diffuse than that of SNB-1::CFP. However, for regions in which punctate expression of CAM-1::YFP was detected, these puncta partially colocalized with SNB-1::CFP puncta. Interestingly, SNB-1::CFP puncta were identified that did not appear to be accompanied by an obvious area of increased CAM-1::YFP expression, suggesting that CAM-1 may be localized to a subset of cholinergic synapses.

In N2 hermaphrodites, expression of cdc-25.2 mRNA was relatively low until L4 larval stage, but the expression increased significantly in young adult (YA; just after the L4 to adult molting but before egg laying has started) and adult (Ad; egg-laying gravid adult worms) stages, when oogenesis actively occurs in hermaphrodite worms. Furthermore, although cdc-25.2 mRNA was expressed in feminized fem-1(hc17lf) hermaphrodites, it was barely detectable in N2 males and in masculinized fem-3(q20gf) hermaphrodites. These results indicate that cdc-25.2 is expressed primarily in oocytes and not in sperm.

During the last larval stage (L4) the 15 pairs of seam cells generated during larval development fuse to form two continuous lateral syncytia, surrounded by hyp7. cdh-3::GFP expression correlates with seam cell identity during these postembryonic divisions; it is not observed in daughters that fuse with hyp7 or adopt other fates. In embryos undergoing morphogenesis, lacZ is expressed in a single large nucleus, whose size and position is consistent with that of the excretory cell. This identification is reinforced by the observation that in many newly hatched L1 larvae, low levels of GFP expression are visible in the excretory cell. This expression of cdh-3-reporter genes was observed only during late embryogenesis and in some newly hatched L1s (the latter may be due to perdurance of the GFP fusion protein), but not at later stages.

WBGene00000435,ceh-10,"Svendsen, 1995","The large majority of ceh-10 mRNA is found in the embryo and likewise the majority of ceh-10 directed reporter gene expression is also found within the embryo. The earliest point at which ceh-10/lacZ expression can be detected is in a single nucleus at the extreme anterior pole of the embryo, at mid-proliferation stage when the embryo has approximately 350 cells. In late proliferation stage embryos, two nuclei and then four nuclei, all at the embryo anterior, express the transgene. As the embryo begins morphogenesis, six nuclei, all at the very anterior pole, stain for  beta-galactosidase activity. By the 1.5-fold stage, the embryo has eight staining nuclei, six at the anterior and two additional cells just ventral to the posterior bulb of the pharynx. By the time the embryo has completed morphogenesis, up to twelve staining nuclei can be detected. ceh-10/lacZ expression in L1 larvae is somewhat variable, in that staining in a particular cell is not always seen in every larva; the likely reason is that the level of ceh-10 mRNA declines after hatching and beta-galactosidase staining in L1 larvae presumably results from enzyme perdurance. Most ceh-10/lacZ staining occurs in the region around the nerve ring, which is dense with the nuclei and processes of neurons.

At the L1 stage, CEH-17 was detected exclusively in the nuclei of five neurons of the ring ganglia. One of the five CEH-17+ neurons was dorsal and just posterior to the nerve ring, while the four others were ventral and close to the posterior bulb of the pharynx. pceh-17::GFP show that the dorsal neuron could be seen projecting two processes towards the ring, which then turned back and coursed along the lateral cords, all the way to the tail of the animal, identifying this neuron as ALA. The four ventral CEH-17 positive neurons were located just posterior to the SMBs, as was described for the SIAs. The four ventral ceh-17 expressing neurons are believed to be  the SIA neurons (SIADR, SIADL, SIAVR and SIAVL). In addition to ALA and the four SIAs, a few other neurons also expressed the pceh-17::GFP construct. flceh-17::GFP staining resulted in the same expression pattern. ceh-17 HD::GFP showed effectively restricted GFP expression to the five neurons seen with the antibody (i.e. ALA and the four SIAs). The fluorescence had a granular appearance and was restricted to the cell body, possibly due to trapping of the chimeric protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. pceh-17::GFP::3 resulted in the same expression pattern (i.e. ALA and the four SIAs), but with axonal staining. The latter construct (pceh-17::GFP::3 ) was used to examine embryonic expression of ceh-17. At the comma stage, expression was detected in two dorsal neurons in the head, presumably corresponding to ALA and its sister RMED, and in six cells on the ventral side of the head, just anterior to the excretory pore. These cells probably correspond to the four SIAs, in which the GFP signal was strongest and revealed sprouting axons, and the two SIBVs, sisters of the SIADs. Two other weakly positive cells on the ventral side were detected, one in the mid-body region and one in the tail, at positions fitting those of motor neurons DB5 and DA8, sisters of the SIAVs. The earliest time at which could detect ceh-17::GFP expression was at the end of gastrulation in four pairs of cells, which could correspond to the four SIAs and their sisters or to the four SIA mothers and their own sisters. Since this is the time when the mothers of SIAs are undergoing their last division, it is not clear whether ceh-17 expression precedes or follows the last cell division.",ALA,DB5,DA8,SIBVR,SIBVL,SIAVR,SIAVL,SIADR,SIADL,RMED

Since neurulation (and presumably cilia growth) occurs in ovo, and since cells at this stage of development are compact and difficult to identify, the authors did not demonstrate that all ciliated neurons express the fusion construct. However, a subset of neurons with ciliated endings (ADL, ASH, ASI, ASJ, PHA, PHB, AQR, and PQR) generally show modest and somewhat variable expression of the fusion construct throughout the life span of the animal. Expression was first noted at approximately 380 - 400 min after fertilization-a time corresponding to the comma stage of development in two cells flanking the developing pharynx. Expression rapidly increased in extent and intensity, peaking in the 3-fold stage in many cells (>30) located anterior and posterior to the nerve ring, as well as in four cells in the developing tail. Expression in the region adjacent to the nerve ring was consistent with all ciliated neurons in this region showing fluorescence. Expression was maintained through most of embryogenesis but decreased in extent and intensity shortly after hatching; late L1 larvae typically showed expression in the phasmids (PHA and PHB) and five or six neuron classes in the head, which usually included ADL, ASK, ASH, ASJ, and ASI but also variably included a subset of ASE, ASG, ADF, AFD, FLP, and ADE. With occasional exceptions, most of the neuron classes anterior to the nerve ring, which based on position may have been BAG, IL1, IL2, OLL, CEP, and OLQ, ceased expressing the reporter late in embryonic development. The neurons with the most elaborate ciliated endings-the amphid wing cells, AWA, AWB, and especially AWC-did not show expression after hatching. Expression did not decrease much further than this as the animal aged. Both these cells showed expression in developing larvae from the L3 stage on. The postdeirid structure in the worm's midbody region also appears postembryonically and contains a ciliated neuron (PDE) that showed clear fluorescence in many animals. This expression was also transiently restricted to a period of time shortly following the appearance of this neuron. In addition, two examples of weak expression in unciliated cells were noted. First, at least one pharyngeal neuron (tentatively identified as I4) showed weak expression in some animals. Finally, barely perceptible fluorescence was occasionally observed in the coelomocytes of some worms.",ASKR,ASKL,ASJR,ASJL,ASIR,ASIL,ASHR,ASHL,ASGR,ASGL,ASER,ASEL,AQR,ADLR,ADLL,ADFR,ADFL,ADER,ADEL,PQR,PHBL,PHAR,PHAL,PDER,PDEL,I4 neuron,FLPR,FLPL,PHBR,coelomocyte,nerve ring

However, these molecules are present at higher concentrations along the lateral region of the nerve cord, where synaptic junctions are abundant, relative to the medial region, which has many fewer synapses. The CLE-1 and NID-1 proteins appear to be present on different faces of the nerve cords relative to synaptic domains. NID-1 is present lateral to the region where synapses form, between the nerve cord and the muscle. CLE-1 is concentrated between the nerve cords and the pseudocoelomic space or overlying muscle arms, i.e., along the dorsal face of the ventral nerve cord and the ventral face of the dorsal nerve cord. Although CLE-1 and NID-1 are found overlapping or closely apposed to UNC-17 along the nerve cords, no consistent association of NID-1 or CLE-1 with UNC-17 puncta was observed, and vice versa. UNC-17 is not present at all of the presynaptic zones in the nerve cords. Similar distributions of CLE-1 and NID-1 relative to a marker for GABAergic presynaptic zones, juIs1, was observed. NID-1 and CLE-1 are also detected in nonsynaptic regions of the nerve cords, but generally at significantly lower levels."

The L2d and dauer larvae develop to the adult worm through the L3 and L4 larval stages, respectively, after the environment shifts to nutrient-rich conditions. pC3894G was continuously expressed in L3; however, it was rarely expressed in L4 and adults recovered from L2d larvae. The expression of the col-43::gfp fusion gene pCTL3894G was not detected due to the signal peptide produced by this fusion gene. The COL-43::GFP fusion protein could be transported into the extracellular matrix and diffuse to an undetectable level. Two promoter deletion constructs, pC1345G and pC1292R, were expressed in the hypodermal cells in the L2d and the L3 stage recovered from the L2d stage. These promoter deletion constructs were continuously expressed in the dauer, the L4 and the adult recovered from stage L2. The additional promoter deletion construct, pC610G was also expressed in the hypodermal cells in the L2d and recovered L3 stage, but was rarely expressed in the L4 stage and adult recovered from the L2d stage. These results indicate that two upstream regions of col-43, within 0.6 kb and from 0.6 kb to 1.3 kb, were required for the expression and up-regulation in the dauer cycle of col-43 expressions, respectively.

This peripheral staining was not of the Golgi complex that was visualized as discrete centralized puncta in coelomocytes.

GFP-CYB-1 fluorescence in fertilized embryos decreased for approximately 12 min and then remained fairly stable for approximately 10 min. These two periods of rapid GFP-CYB-1 turnover and of GFP-CYB-1 stability coincide with the timing of meiosis I and meiosis II, respectively. Twenty to twenty-four minutes after the start of GFP-CYB-1 proteolysis, at a time when meiosis II is expected to be completed, fluorescence levels decreased again and approached zero. Pronuclei were observed at the end of this period indicating that the embryos had entered interphase. In 9/9 unfertilized embryos, GFP-CYB-1 fluorescence decreased rapidly after exit from the spermatheca just as in fertilized embryos. This is consistent with the occurrence of anaphase I in unfertilized embryos, in contrast with unfertilized vertebrate eggs which arrest at metaphase with high levels of cyclin B. A significant difference was observed between the unfertilized and the fertilized embryos at the time that meiosis II was expected to be completed in fertilized embryos. The second phase of decreasing GFP-CYB-1 fluorescence intensity did not occur in unfertilized embryos to the extent observed in fertilized embryos. At 27 min after spermatheca exit, GFP-CYB-1 fluorescence intensity was 7 +/- 5% (n = 6) of the value in the proximal oocyte in fertilized embryos and 19 +/- 10% (n = 9) in unfertilized embryos. This difference was statistically significant (P = .001) indicating that cyclin B proteolysis is not complete in unfertilized embryos.

In the 2-cell stage embryo, the DAO-5 signal consists of 15-25 small dots of varying intensity distributed throughout each nucleus. Nucleolus-like structures were never observed at this early stage. The first appearance of a nucleolar structure occurs at the 6- to 8-cell stage, when larger spherical bodies (~0.5 mm in diameter) are immunodetected amidst the dot-like signals. Shortly after, the number of small dot-like signals that are detected decreases drastically (but some persist until later stages) and, except for the germline cell, all embryonic nuclei then harbor one or, in the vast majority, two distinct DAO- 5 or FIB-1 signals of equal size and intensity. This pattern remains broadly similar throughout embryogenesis, with the notable exception that intestinal nuclei often contain a single large DAO-5/FIB-1 positive nucleolus at later stages. It should be noted that at all embryonic stages examined, a substantial pool of diffuse nucleoplasmic DAO-5 was also detected. In the adult, the localization of DAO-5 was examined in more detail in the polyploid intestinal nuclei, which contain a large centrally-located nucleolus. In these nucleoli, the DAO-5 signal describes a hollow sphere that surrounds a DNA-poor core. In addition to being present in this portion of the nucleolus, DAO-5 is found in numerous small punctate structures throughout the nucleoplasm of intestinal nuclei.

All ten seam cells in newly hatched L1 larvae showed strong egl-18 expression. After their first division, egl-18::mCherry expression was asymmetric between the daughters, with stronger expression in the posterior daughters that maintain the seam cell fate. Expression in the anterior daughter faded after division, before the hypodermal daughters moved out of the seam cell line. During the L2 stage, several seam cells undergo a symmetric expansion division, generating two seam daughters and increasing the seam cell number from 10 to 16 (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977). In the early L2, strong symmetric expression of egl-18::mCherry was seen in both seam-fated daughters of these divisions. When these seam-fated daughters underwent their subsequent L2 and L3 stage asymmetric divisions, reporter expression faded in their anterior, hypodermal-fated daughters as observed in the L1 stage.

Additional analyses revealed that the downstream half (350 bp) of the 650-bp region was sufficient for vulval expression. Neither half of the 350-bp region (pYB16 and pYB19) resulted in vulval expression above the background, which suggests that both halves of the f350-bp region are important for vulval expression.

At higher resolution there was a periodicity to these lines that approximated the distance between the dense body adhesion sites. The ELP-1::GFP fluorescence slightly overlaps the edges of the dense bodies but is not superimposable with the dense bodies at this angle. These results indicate that ELP-1 is unlikely to be a component of the dense bodies. Double-stained muscle cells with anti-ELP-1 antibodies and a monoclonal antibody MH25 against PAT-3 shows that integrin and ELP-1 have overlapping staining patterns at this level of resolution. Because of the relatively impenetrable cuticle that surrounds the nematode, these worms were frozen and cracked open prior to antibody staining. In areas lacking dense bodies, ELP-1::GFP was sometimes lost. However most of the ELP-1::GFP was retained in a linear pattern. These results indicate that the membrane and dense bodies can be separated from the ELP-1::GFP."

Just prior to morphogenesis, reporter gene expression could be seen in all the major hypodermal cell nuclei. During formation of the comma stage, embryo reporter gene expression declined in the dorsal and ventral hypodermis but remained high in the lateral seam cells. The seam-cell expression of the reporter gene continued throughout morphogenesis to the pretzel stage although at lower levels. In addition, at the threefold stage of development high levels of expression were seen in a group of cells adjacent to the pharynx in a position consistent with neuronal cells of the retrovesicular ganglion. During postembryonic development relatively low levels of expression were maintained in seam cells from the L1 to the adult stage as were high levels of ELT-1 in neuronal cells of the retrovesicular ganglion. ELT-1 expression was also clearly apparent in several different groups of neuronal cell bodies and axons; those of the ventral cord were the most prominent. Expression was also seen in several neurons in which the axon extended from the ventral cord and encircled the pharynx just in front of the posterior bulb.The reporter gene also showed postembryonic expression in sex-specific structures.

Ce-emerin was not detected in cells undergoing spermiogenesis that had reached the stage of having condensed chromatin. However, we could not definitively conclude that emerin was absent from sperm, because sperm lack Ce-lamin (Liu et al., 2000) and therefore had no positive control for antibody access into these cells during staining. Nevertheless, the nearly ubiquitous positive staining seen for Ce-emerin throughout development and in adult animals was similar to that seen for human emerin, which is found in most cell types examined (Manilal et al., 1999)."

SP56 was first seen approximately 6 hr after the molt from L3 to L4 (3 hr, n = 17; 6 hr, n = 14; 10 hr, n = 19), where staining was limited to the proximal-most germ cells. As animals matured through the L4 stage, the SP56 domain expanded distally to include an increasing number of cells. Importantly, FOG-1 and SP56 were not present in the same cells at the same time. Instead, FOG-1 staining preceded SP56 staining in both time and space. For example, the proximal-most germ cells expressed FOG-1 in late L3 and early L4 ; those same cells expressed SP56 in mid-L4 (6 hr), when the FOG-1 domain had moved distally.

GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 were detected at the spindle asters and at the membranes between germ-precursor nuclei in the distal gonad arms. During the formation and maturation of oocytes, GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 localized diffusely to the cytoplasm and more prominently to the nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes, in particular to membranes between adjacent oocytes. Following fertilization and meiosis, GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 appeared at the duplicated centrosomes associated with the sperm pronucleus. GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 both became progressively more abundant at the spindle asters during the formation of the first mitotic spindle. Both proteins also localized diffusely around the kinetochore MTs in metaphase. Although the latter localization disappeared in early anaphase, GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 persisted at the spindle asters until chromosome decondensation in telophase. On completion of cell cleavage, GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 were detected only at the cell cortex and cytoplasm. This pattern of spindle-associated localizations was repeated during subsequent mitotic divisions.

The level of cortical localization of GPR-1/2 increased and became weakly enriched at the posterior pole of most embryos during anaphase. In some embryos with enriched posterior staining, GPR-1/2 also appeared to be slightly enriched at the anterior pole of the embryo, compared with lateral regions. GPR-1/2 asymmetry became more pronounced during cytokinesis and interphase of the two-cell stage. In the P1 blastomere during interphase, GPR-1/2 were highly enriched around the posterior pole of the cell, and were present at low levels uniformly around the cortex of AB. As the cell cycle progressed, GPR-1/2 asymmetry in P1 disappeared; GPR-1/2 were uniformly localized around the cortex through out prophase, metaphase and early anaphase.

The punctate localisation of CeHCF represented very specific and frequently quantitative colocalisation with mitochondria. This was observed with several independent mitochondrial markers for mitotracker, a mitochondrial specific dye. More diffuse cytoplasmic staining could sometimes be observed in addition to the cytoplasmic mitochondrial localisation, and in a significant fraction of cells (~25%) there was very little nuclear accumulation."

Nuclei that are in the earliest stages of chromosome condensation do not stain with mAb 6C4. Staining with mAb 6C4 was first observed in prophase nuclei that contain condensed chromosomes. At this stage, mAb 6C4 staining was observed as dots distributed throughout the nucleus; many of these dots colocalize with the chromosomes. These chromosome-associated dots are widely dispersed along the entire length of each chromosome. Later in prophase, mAb 6C4 stained structures located on opposite sides of each chromosome. In metaphase, when the chromosomes are aligned at the equatorial plane, chromosomes were oriented with each mAb 6C4 stained structure facing one centrosome. At anaphase, sister chromatids separated with the mAb 6C4 stained side on the poleward face of each sister chromatid. No mAb 6C4 staining was detectable by late anaphase. These results show that there is dynamic localization of the mAb 6C4 antigen to chromosomes throughout mitosis. mAb 6C4 Staining during meiosis During meiosis, C. elegans chromosomes lack a trilaminar kinetochore structure, and attachment to the meiotic spindle is mediated through the chromosome ends. No mAb 6C4 nuclear staining was detected in the mitotic region of the gonad of the hermaphrodite nor in oocytes arrested at diakinesis of prophase I. After fertilization, embryos exit prophase I arrest and undergo two consecutive rounds of division to form two polar bodies. Staining with mAb 6C4 was detected on meiotic chromosomes after fertilization and before first olar body formation.

It appears that most of the AB cells in the embryo stain, and what appears to be the cells of the C lineage. Some embryos exhibit staining in the two rows of nuclei that are the E lineage. All embryonic staining is very intense, and it spreads to the cytoplasm giving blue embryos, therefore obscuring the DAPI staining, making it difficult to count the number of cells in the embryos as each component begins expressing. This intense staining fades as the embryo ages, sometimes leaving blue comma stage embryos with no distinct nuclei staining. Hypodermal expression is seen in the 3 fold stage of embryogenesis and in young larvae which most probably are C-derived hyp-7 nuclei.

Frequently, HIM-8 foci have a crescent-shaped appearance, especially in the transition zone, as if the protein localizes to a patch along the nuclear surface.

Costaining with P-granule-specific antibodies revealed that the structures containing the cytoplasmic HIS-24 protein are not the P-granules. Cytoplasmic HIS-24 is characteristic for most developmental stages of the germ line, it is found in the mitotic region of the gonad, in the transition zone, in the meiotic region, and during all stages of oogenesis.

WBGene00001949,hlh-2,"Krause et al., 1997","CeE/DA can first be detected in both nuclei of 2-cell embryos. Staining persists apparently in all nuclei of the early embryo for the first 150-200 minutes of development (100-200 cells). By 270 minutes of development (approx. 350 cells) a dramatic change in antibody staining has occurred in which persistent staining is seen in progressively fewer blastomeres. Most, but not all, blastomeres that initially retain CeE/DA antibody staining at this stage are neurons or their immediate precursors. There are a few neuronal precursors that are located away from the neuronal clusters in the embryo (for example the postembryonic neuroblast W), for which antibody staining was not detected. Therefore, although persistent antibody staining is largely restricted to neurons or their precursors, not every such cell is antibody-positive. CeE/DA-antibody staining is transient for the majority of these cells, with the staining progressively lost as differentiation and morphogenesis occur. This is most clearly evident at the 1.5-fold stage of embryogenesis, in which a lateral view of the embryo shows staining in the head, ventral nerve cord and tail. As the embryo begins elongating, the level of CeE/DA-antibody staining decreases in these cells. Note that most of these cells are postmitotic. Although the majority of cells lose CeE/DA-antibody staining during the later half of embryogenesis, a small percentage of cells remain antibody-positive through the remainder of embryogenesis and after hatching. There are 14 of these continually staining cells in the head and seven more in the tail region. Of the 14 head cells, 5 are pharyngeal. The pharyngeal nuclei have been identified, as two pharyngeal muscle nuclei (pm5L and R) and three pharyngeal gland cell nuclei (g1P, g2L and R). The remaining nine CeE/DA antibody-positive cells in the head are outside of the pharynx and are located in the neuronal cluster between the nerve ring and the posterior pharyngeal bulb. There are four bilateral pairs of stained nuclei and one positive nucleus lying along the ventral mid-line. Using hlh-2::GFP reporter strains and DiI staining, three of the bilateral pairs of neurons have been identified as ADL (L and R) and ASH (L and R) and RIC (L and R). The large number of neurons in this area makes it difficult to identify unambiguously each of the remaining three CeE/DA antibody-positive cells. The seven tail cells with nuclei that remain CeE/DA antibody-positive throughout embryonic development include the two Q neuroblasts and five cells were tentatively identified as DVA (an interneuron), the bilateral pair of intestinal muscle cells, the anal depressor muscle and the anal sphincter muscle. The two intestinal and two anal muscle cells are postmitotic and are non-striated muscles.",pm5,ASHR,ASHL,RICR,RICL,ADLR,ADLL,AB,QR,QL,anal depressor muscle,gon_herm_dtc_P,gon_herm_dtc_A,g2R,g2L,g1P,Z3,Z2,DVA,gonad,uterine muscle,intestinal muscle,anal sphincter muscle,vulval muscle,ABarpaapa,ABalppapa,ABprpappp,ABplapaap,ABalpaaap,ABprpapp,ABaraapa,MSapaaa,ABarppap,ABarapaaa,ABaraaap,ABplaapaa,ABarpapap,MSpaap,ABplaapap,MSaaapp,MSaaaa,ABpraaapa,ABplaapp,Cpapp,MSapa,Caaaa,MSaapaa,ABprapppa,MSppaap,Caap,ABalapppp,ABalpappa,MSppaaa,ABprppapp,MSpaaa,ABalpaap,ABalppapp,ABprpppa,ABalppaa,ABplaappp,ABplpapaa,ABprapaaa,Cpapa,Cppaa,MSpapap,ABarapaap,ABaraappa,ABalaaap,ABprppppp,ABprppaa,ABplppaaa,Epl,ABarappa,ABaraapap,MSppppp,ABalppaap,Cpppa,ABplppap,MSpaaap,ABpraappa,MSapp,ABalaappa,ABarpppaa,MSapppa,Dpa,ABprpaapa,ABarppaap,ABprppppa,ABprapppp,ABalppppp,ABplppaap,Cpppp,ABpraapap,ABaraappp,ABplappap,MSapaap,MSppapp,ABplpaap,MSaaaaa,ABplpapa,ABprpappa,ABalpppp,ABplppapa,ABprppapa,ABplappa,Capp,ABplpaaaa,Eala,MSapppp,ABpraapaa,ABalppap,ABplpaapa,Caapa,MSappp,ABalppaaa,ABalaapa,ABalapapp,ABaraaaaa,ABplaaapp,ABalapaa,ABpraaaap,MSaaaap,MSpaaaa,ABarapapp,MSpappa,ABaraapp,ABalaaaar,ABalappa,MSaaap,Eara,ABprapaa,ABalappap,ABprpaaa,Cppa,ABplppaa,MSpppap,ABplpapap,ABprpppp,ABalpaapa,Cappp,ABarppppp,ABaraaapp,ABalpaaaa,Dpp,MSaappa,MSpapp,MSpaapp,Dap,ABprpapap,Cpaaa,ABalapaap,MSppppa,ABprappap,ABplpppaa,ABalapaaa,ABplpappa,MSapaa,ABprpppap,MSapapa,ABarppapp,ABalappp,MSappap,ABarpppap,ABprpaap,ABprpapa,MSpappp,Caaap,Cppp,ABprappa,ABpraappp,ABarpappa,ABprpaaaa,ABalpapap,Daa,ABprapapp,MSaaapa,ABarppppa,ABpraapa,ABarpappp,Capap,ABaraaaap,ABplpaaap,ABalapapa,ABplpaaa,ABalppppa,Epra,ABarapppa,ABarapap,ABpraapp,ABprppap,ABplaaaaa,ABprappaa,MSpapaa,ABplppppa,ABplppapp,ABaraaaa,Ear,ABplappaa,ABalappaa,ABalaapaa,MSppap,ABarpapaa,ABalpapaa,ABplpappp,ABarpaaa,ABalpppaa,ABprppaap,MSpppp,ABplapapp,ABplpapp,ABplpaapp,ABplpppa,ABplapap,MSaapp,ABalaaaa,Eal,ABpraaaa,Capa,ABprpapaa,MSppa,ABalpappp,ABarppaa,ABplappp,ABplapaaa,MSapap,ABalapppa,ABplaaap,MSpppa,ABprpaaap,MSapapp,Eplp,ABarpaaap,Eprp,MSappaa,ABprapapa,Da,ABarpapp,ABarapaa,Cpaa,ABarpaap,ABplaappa,ABarappp,ABarppapa,MSppaa,ABarpppp,MSaapap,ABpraaap,MSaapa,Ealp,Epr,ABprpppaa,ABalaapp,MSpaapa,ABalpaaa,ABalapap,Caaa,ABarapppp,ABarappap,ABalpapa,ABplppppp,ABprppaaa,ABplaaaa,ABaraaapa,Cpaap,ABarpapa,ABprpaapp,ABalpapp,MSppapa,ABplaapa,ABarpaapp,ABprapaap,ABplaaaap,ABalaapap,Cpap,ABpraaaaa,ABarpaaaa,ABalpppap,ABarapapa,Earp,ABplpppp,ABalpppa,ABaraapaa,ABplapppp,Epla,ABarappaa,Cappa,ABplpppap,Capaa,MSpapa,ABplapapa,ABprapap,ABplaaapa,ABalaappp,ABalaaapa,ABarpppa,ABplapppa,Cppap,ABprappp,ABalaaapp,ABalpaapp,MSppp,MSaappp,ABpraaapp,MSappa,Dp,Caapp,ABalaaaal,ABplapaa,MSpppaa,ABarppaaa,Psub1

This expression is undetectable by the early L1 larval stage. The most conspicuous expression during L1 is within the P cell lineages. Specifically, hlh-3 is expressed in the ectodermal-like P cells, and expression persists in the primary and secondary neural precursors of the P cell lineages. In addition, it appears to be expressed in all 53 of the resulting postmitotic motor neurons. Expression in most of these neurons is undetectable by the L2 larval stage. It is worth noting here that these neurons represent 77% of all motor neurons mediating locomotion. hlh-3 is also expressed in the HSNs and ventral type C (VC) motor neurons throughout larval development. At hatching, expression in the HSNs is weak, but peaks at the L3 larval stage and persists until the late L4 larval stage. Expression in the VCs also peaks during L3. Overall, hlh-3 appears to be expressed in all neural precursors. Based on expression in the P cell lineages, expression generally persists through terminal cell division and disappears from postmitotic neurons shortly thereafter.

At approximately the time adherens junctions begin to form in the hypodermis, HMP-1 protein accumulates to high levels along the apical margins of all hypodermal cells (all hypodermal staining lies within a 1-um focal plane near the cell surface). During migration of ventral hypodermal cells, HMP-1 antiserum staining is not detected at the leading edges of these cells. HMP-1 becomes localized to the ventral margins of these cells as they contact contralateral cells at the ventral midline. During body elongation, the HMP-1 antiserum stains predominantly the apical margins of all hypodermal, pharyngeal, and intestinal cells, as does the mAbMH27 antiserum.

In the spermatheca of hermaphrodites, HSP12s are localized in sperm. At higher magnification, the distribution of HSP12 cytoplasmic staining in sperm cells is seen to be spherically symmetrical. In males, spermatids are stored in the seminal vesicle, and most sperm cells mature following ejaculation; the extensive labelling of HSP12 in male germ cells therefore indicates localization of this smHSP to spermatids and perhaps spermatocytes. Cells in the mitotic region of the male gonad, however, are not labelled. In hermaphrodites, HSP12s are also expressed in a subset of vulval muscle cells (A9A12).

In distal arms clusters of fine puncta were associated with each germ cell, as previously reported for INX-14 and INX-22 expression (Govindan et al. 2009). INX-8/9 (antibodies raised against INX-8 shown to cross-react with INX-9) INX-8::GFP and INX-9::GFP were expressed in the distal tip cell (DTC) in addition to the somatic sheath. In the DTC, INX-8/9, INX-8::GFP and INX-9::GFP associated with long processes that extended from the DTC proximally, especially those running between germ cells and intercalating among them. At the distal limit of sheath cell coverage of germ cells, longer formations sometimes appeared associated with the apparent edge of the sheath cells. At the loop region of the gonad arm, individual puncta appeared in larger, higher-density aggregates. In the proximal arm puncta size was more variable, with many appearing to be considerably larger than the fine puncta seen in the distal arm. The expression levels of INX-8, INX-9 appeared higher in the proximal gonad. Throughout the gonad the localization patterns of INX-8::GFP and INX-9::GFP were indistinguishable. In addition to gonadal expression, antibody staining of whole mounts suggested that INX-8/9 may be expressed in some pharyngeal and a few other head neurons (T. Starich, unpublished results), but because the antibody reacted primarily with processes and not cell bodies we did not attempt to identify these neurons. Male gonads were examined and found to express INX-8, -9, -14, -21 and -22 as well. Presumptive gap junctions forming between both male distal tip cells and germ cells were detected with antibodies specific to INX-8/9, INX-14, INX-21, and INX-22. INX-8::GFP and INX-9::GFP were both expressed in the DTCs. No expression was detected in the transition zone, but innexin expression appeared to outline individual germ cells in the pachytene region. All 5 innexins are also expressed in the regions occupied by differentiated spermatocytes and sperm, with evidence of puncta formation. Expression of INX-9::GFP visualized somatic coverage of spermatids, probably by cells of the seminal vesicle, but somatic coverage of germ cells in the pachytene region of the male gonad has not been described. Examination of earlier developmental stages showed that all five innexins are expressed in the primordial gonad, consisting of somatic gonadal precursors Z1 and Z4 and the primordial germ cells Z2 and Z3. Early larval expression patterns differ from adults in that distinct, well-defined puncta potentially corresponding to gap junctions are less clearly discernible. In L2-L4 larval stages, germ cell innexins appear to be continually expressed, and somatic innexins are expressed predominantly in the DTC. In late L2 and early L3 stages, as the gonad arm lengthens, the migrating DTC seems to trail a process behind it that maintains contact with the germ cell compartment. The DTC appears to form gap junctions with germ cells at both long external processes and processes that intercalate between germ cells. At this time a second, more proximal focus of somatic innexin expression was sometimes detected. Though this second focus might represent extensions from the DTC, expression of inx-9::gfp suggested that other somatic cells besides the DTC might be involved. By the late L3 stage, the DTC no longer appears to be in contact with all of the germ cells. To better understand the contacts between germ cells and the DTC, we examined early L4-stage animals by TEM. We observed several processes trailing behind the DTC cell body on the outer edge of the germ line, as well as extensions that dig deeply between germ cells. The immunofluorescence results suggest that gap junctions form between the DTC and germ cells at both the outer and inner DTC arms. The inx-8 promoter was fused to mCherry, and inx-8p::mCherry was expressed during larval development in most or all of the somatic gonad cells derived from Z1 and Z4, including the DTC, sheath/spermathecal precursors and uterine cell precursors. We conclude that although expression of INX-8/9 appears to be strongest in the DTC during larval development, other somatic gonad cells may also express INX-8/9 at this time.",Z4,Z3,Z2,Z1,gonad,pharyngeal neuron,gonadal sheath cell,head neuron,sperm,spermatocyte,DTC

In distal arms clusters of fine puncta were associated with each germ cell, as previously reported for INX-14 and INX-22 expression (Govindan et al. 2009). INX-14, -21 and -22 colocalized to puncta associated with long processes that extended from the DTC proximally, especially those running between germ cells and intercalating among them. At the distal limit of sheath cell coverage of germ cells, longer formations sometimes appeared associated with the apparent edge of the sheath cells. At the loop region of the gonad arm, individual puncta appeared in larger, higher-density aggregates. In the proximal arm puncta size was more variable, with many appearing to be considerably larger than the fine puncta seen in the distal arm. Although all innexins appeared to colocalize, INX-21 differed from the other innexins in that its expression level was relatively higher in the distal gonad compared to the proximal gonad. In contrast, the expression levels of INX-8, INX-9, INX-14, INX-22 appeared higher in the proximal gonad. Male gonads were examined and found to express INX-8, -9, -14, -21 and -22 as well. Presumptive gap junctions forming between both male distal tip cells and germ cells were detected with antibodies specific to INX-8/9, INX-14, INX-21, and INX-22. All 5 innexins are also expressed in the regions occupied by differentiated spermatocytes and sperm, with evidence of puncta formation. Examination of earlier developmental stages showed that all five innexins are expressed in the primordial gonad, consisting of somatic gonadal precursors Z1 and Z4 and the primordial germ cells Z2 and Z3. In a few serendipitous cases expression of INX-22 was detected prior to hatching, in pretzel-stage embryos. Early larval expression patterns differ from adults in that distinct, well-defined puncta potentially corresponding to gap junctions are less clearly discernible. In L2-L4 larval stages, germ cell innexins appear to be continually expressed, and somatic innexins are expressed predominantly in the DTC. In late L2 and early L3 stages, as the gonad arm lengthens, the migrating DTC seems to trail a process behind it that maintains contact with the germ cell compartment. The DTC appears to form gap junctions with germ cells at both long external processes and processes that intercalate between germ cells. At this time a second, more proximal focus of somatic innexin expression was sometimes detected. Though this second focus might represent extensions from the DTC, expression of inx-9::gfp suggested that other somatic cells besides the DTC might be involved. By the late L3 stage, the DTC no longer appears to be in contact with all of the germ cells. To better understand the contacts between germ cells and the DTC, we examined early L4-stage animals by TEM.

WBGene00002285,let-7,"Van et al., 2011","Fluorescence was observed at the end of the L1 stage in transgenic worms that express GFP fused to the pri-let-7B start site. Detection of GFP mRNA, driven by both let-7 promoter A and B sequences in the transgenic worms, mirrored that of endogenous let-7 primary transcripts, indicating that expression of let-7 is repressed largely at the transcriptional level from embryogenesis until the late L1 stage. Consistent with the reporter analysis, pri-let-7  was first observed during the late L1 stage. We detected all three pri-let-7 isoforms, and coordinate expression of these isoforms oscillated throughout development. The low levels of pri-let-7 at most mid-larval time points and the slight shifts in the timing of pri-let-7 expression between experiments indicate that expression of endogenous pri-let-7 transcripts is dynamic, and that even slight changes in culture conditions can affect the rate of development and thus pri-let-7 expression. GFP mRNA levels of the let-7 promoter reporter oscillated with a frequency identical to that of endogenous pri-let-7 expression, suggesting that transcriptional mechanisms largely control the cycling pattern of pri-let-7 expression.  Consistent with previous reports, pre- and mature let-7 RNAs were undetectable until the L3 stage. In the L3 and L4 stages, levels of pre-let-7 oscillated in parallel to those of pri-let-7, while mature let-7 accumulated to a relatively constant level."
WBGene00002285,let-7,"Kai, Finnegan,  Huang, & Pasquinelli, 2013","let-7 primary transcripts are first detected at the end of the first larval stage and exhibit pulses of expression near the molt of each larval stage.  Both of the plet-7::GFP constructs drove temporally regulated expression, initially observed at the end of the first larval stage (L1). Starting in late L1 (~10 h at 25C), robust GFP was seen in muscle and neuronal cells in the head, including the nerve ring. Midway through L2, GFP accumulated in the neurons and muscle cells of the tail, body wall muscle (BWM), and ventral nerve cord (VNC). Beginning in L3, all transgenic lines began to express GFP in vulva precursor cells. After the onset of GFP expression in a particular tissue, it was maintained until adults became gravid with embryos (~52 h at 25 C). GFP was not detected in the germ line. Although plet-7A::GFP and plet-7B::GFP transgenics showed similar spatio-temporal expression patterns in most cell types, they were not entirely overlapping. In hypodermal and seam cells, the plet-7B::GFP reporter produced a robust GFP signal at the L3 stage. However, plet-7A::GFP animals exhibited only weak, transient expression of GFP in the hypodermal cells beginning at the L3 stage. Early in the second stage of development, all intestinal cells showed high expression of GFP in plet-7B::GFP transgenic animals, while GFP was undetectable in the intestine of plet-7A::GFP transgenic animals.",hypodermis,tail,seam cell,intestine,body wall musculature,ventral nerve cord,nerve ring,head neuron,head muscle,vulval precursor cell

Once transcriptionally activated, Plin-4::GFP-pest and Plet-7::GFP-pest reporters peak in expression by 1820 hours and diminish with similar kinetics. For animals expressing the Plet-7::GFP-pest reporter GFP-pest expression was monitored for longer periods after release from L1 arrest. Consistent with the highly pulsatile nature of this expression pattern, GFP-pest expression was reinitiated at 30 hours, which correlates with the later portions of the L2 stage. While transcriptional activation of the Pmir-1::GFP-pest reporter was also initiated at 14 hours post-L1 arrest, the peak of Pmir-1::GFPpest expression occurred at a later time point, and diminished with slower kinetics, as compared to Plin-4::GFP-pest and Plet- 7::GFP-pest expression.The majority of animals which harbor the Plin-4::GFP-pest transgene cease GFP-pest expression by L3 ecdysis and resume expression by the mid-L4 stage. The pulse of Plin-4::GFP-pest expression at the L4 stage extends through the early portion of young adulthood and completely overlaps with the lethargus period in all animals. Plet-7::GFP-pest expression followed a similar pattern. However, GFP-pest expression was more variable at the L3-to-L4 transition and L4-specific induction of this transgene was primarily restricted to the lethargus period. In contrast to the expression profiles of the lin-4 and let-7 reporters, induction of Pmir-1::GFP-pest expression began during, or immediately after, L3 ecdysis and persisted into the L4 stage. A second pulse of Pmir-1::GFP-pest expression completely overlapped with the L4 lethargus period and continued into early adulthood. Collectively, these results suggest that the expression patterns of lin-4, let-7 and mir-1 are dynamic throughout development and that the cyclical transcription of these miRNAs is mediated by their cognate promoter sequences."
