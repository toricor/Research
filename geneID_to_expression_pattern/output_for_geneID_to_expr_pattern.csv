In addition, a prominent signal was present in a symmetrical pair of neurons also located in the vicinity of the anterior pharyngeal bulb. With processes running toward the tip of the animals extreme anterior, this pair of neurons displays a typical feature of chemosensory neurons exposed to the environment through specialized structures in the cuticle.

In addition, a signal was visible in the body wall muscles around the worm mouth. The signal detected in the posterior region was considered autofluorescence (as visible in other animals).

Deletion of the predicted transmembrane domain led to secretion of the protein into the culture media. Immunostaining of the FLAG-tagged ABU-1expressing COS1 cells with anti-FLAG antibodies showed a diffuse reticular pattern that colocalized with the ER marker ribophorin I. These results suggest that ABU-1 encodes an integral membrane protein that is retained in the ER by its transmembrane domain. The secretion of transmembrane domain deleted ABU-1 suggests that the lumenal portion of the protein folds properly in mammalian cells and that the full-length ABU-1 is unlikely to be retained in the ER as a consequence of malfolding in mammalian cells."

By using the acr-2 promoter to drive expression of SNB-1::CFP in cholinergic VA and VB motor neurons, CAM-1::YFP expression in cholinergic motor neurons was, in general, more diffuse than that of SNB-1::CFP. However, for regions in which punctate expression of CAM-1::YFP was detected, these puncta partially colocalized with SNB-1::CFP puncta. Interestingly, SNB-1::CFP puncta were identified that did not appear to be accompanied by an obvious area of increased CAM-1::YFP expression, suggesting that CAM-1 may be localized to a subset of cholinergic synapses.

In N2 hermaphrodites, expression of cdc-25.2 mRNA was relatively low until L4 larval stage, but the expression increased significantly in young adult (YA; just after the L4 to adult molting but before egg laying has started) and adult (Ad; egg-laying gravid adult worms) stages, when oogenesis actively occurs in hermaphrodite worms. Furthermore, although cdc-25.2 mRNA was expressed in feminized fem-1(hc17lf) hermaphrodites, it was barely detectable in N2 males and in masculinized fem-3(q20gf) hermaphrodites. These results indicate that cdc-25.2 is expressed primarily in oocytes and not in sperm.

During the last larval stage (L4) the 15 pairs of seam cells generated during larval development fuse to form two continuous lateral syncytia, surrounded by hyp7. cdh-3::GFP expression correlates with seam cell identity during these postembryonic divisions; it is not observed in daughters that fuse with hyp7 or adopt other fates. In embryos undergoing morphogenesis, lacZ is expressed in a single large nucleus, whose size and position is consistent with that of the excretory cell. This identification is reinforced by the observation that in many newly hatched L1 larvae, low levels of GFP expression are visible in the excretory cell. This expression of cdh-3-reporter genes was observed only during late embryogenesis and in some newly hatched L1s (the latter may be due to perdurance of the GFP fusion protein), but not at later stages.

WBGene00000435,ceh-10,"Svendsen, 1995","The large majority of ceh-10 mRNA is found in the embryo and likewise the majority of ceh-10 directed reporter gene expression is also found within the embryo. The earliest point at which ceh-10/lacZ expression can be detected is in a single nucleus at the extreme anterior pole of the embryo, at mid-proliferation stage when the embryo has approximately 350 cells. In late proliferation stage embryos, two nuclei and then four nuclei, all at the embryo anterior, express the transgene. As the embryo begins morphogenesis, six nuclei, all at the very anterior pole, stain for  beta-galactosidase activity. By the 1.5-fold stage, the embryo has eight staining nuclei, six at the anterior and two additional cells just ventral to the posterior bulb of the pharynx. By the time the embryo has completed morphogenesis, up to twelve staining nuclei can be detected. ceh-10/lacZ expression in L1 larvae is somewhat variable, in that staining in a particular cell is not always seen in every larva; the likely reason is that the level of ceh-10 mRNA declines after hatching and beta-galactosidase staining in L1 larvae presumably results from enzyme perdurance. Most ceh-10/lacZ staining occurs in the region around the nerve ring, which is dense with the nuclei and processes of neurons.

At the L1 stage, CEH-17 was detected exclusively in the nuclei of five neurons of the ring ganglia. One of the five CEH-17+ neurons was dorsal and just posterior to the nerve ring, while the four others were ventral and close to the posterior bulb of the pharynx. pceh-17::GFP show that the dorsal neuron could be seen projecting two processes towards the ring, which then turned back and coursed along the lateral cords, all the way to the tail of the animal, identifying this neuron as ALA. The four ventral CEH-17 positive neurons were located just posterior to the SMBs, as was described for the SIAs. The four ventral ceh-17 expressing neurons are believed to be  the SIA neurons (SIADR, SIADL, SIAVR and SIAVL). In addition to ALA and the four SIAs, a few other neurons also expressed the pceh-17::GFP construct. flceh-17::GFP staining resulted in the same expression pattern. ceh-17 HD::GFP showed effectively restricted GFP expression to the five neurons seen with the antibody (i.e. ALA and the four SIAs). The fluorescence had a granular appearance and was restricted to the cell body, possibly due to trapping of the chimeric protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. pceh-17::GFP::3 resulted in the same expression pattern (i.e. ALA and the four SIAs), but with axonal staining. The latter construct (pceh-17::GFP::3 ) was used to examine embryonic expression of ceh-17. At the comma stage, expression was detected in two dorsal neurons in the head, presumably corresponding to ALA and its sister RMED, and in six cells on the ventral side of the head, just anterior to the excretory pore. These cells probably correspond to the four SIAs, in which the GFP signal was strongest and revealed sprouting axons, and the two SIBVs, sisters of the SIADs. Two other weakly positive cells on the ventral side were detected, one in the mid-body region and one in the tail, at positions fitting those of motor neurons DB5 and DA8, sisters of the SIAVs. The earliest time at which could detect ceh-17::GFP expression was at the end of gastrulation in four pairs of cells, which could correspond to the four SIAs and their sisters or to the four SIA mothers and their own sisters. Since this is the time when the mothers of SIAs are undergoing their last division, it is not clear whether ceh-17 expression precedes or follows the last cell division.",ALA,DB5,DA8,SIBVR,SIBVL,SIAVR,SIAVL,SIADR,SIADL,RMED

Since neurulation (and presumably cilia growth) occurs in ovo, and since cells at this stage of development are compact and difficult to identify, the authors did not demonstrate that all ciliated neurons express the fusion construct. However, a subset of neurons with ciliated endings (ADL, ASH, ASI, ASJ, PHA, PHB, AQR, and PQR) generally show modest and somewhat variable expression of the fusion construct throughout the life span of the animal. Expression was first noted at approximately 380 - 400 min after fertilization-a time corresponding to the comma stage of development in two cells flanking the developing pharynx. Expression rapidly increased in extent and intensity, peaking in the 3-fold stage in many cells (>30) located anterior and posterior to the nerve ring, as well as in four cells in the developing tail. Expression in the region adjacent to the nerve ring was consistent with all ciliated neurons in this region showing fluorescence. Expression was maintained through most of embryogenesis but decreased in extent and intensity shortly after hatching; late L1 larvae typically showed expression in the phasmids (PHA and PHB) and five or six neuron classes in the head, which usually included ADL, ASK, ASH, ASJ, and ASI but also variably included a subset of ASE, ASG, ADF, AFD, FLP, and ADE. With occasional exceptions, most of the neuron classes anterior to the nerve ring, which based on position may have been BAG, IL1, IL2, OLL, CEP, and OLQ, ceased expressing the reporter late in embryonic development. The neurons with the most elaborate ciliated endings-the amphid wing cells, AWA, AWB, and especially AWC-did not show expression after hatching. Expression did not decrease much further than this as the animal aged. Both these cells showed expression in developing larvae from the L3 stage on. The postdeirid structure in the worm's midbody region also appears postembryonically and contains a ciliated neuron (PDE) that showed clear fluorescence in many animals. This expression was also transiently restricted to a period of time shortly following the appearance of this neuron. In addition, two examples of weak expression in unciliated cells were noted. First, at least one pharyngeal neuron (tentatively identified as I4) showed weak expression in some animals. Finally, barely perceptible fluorescence was occasionally observed in the coelomocytes of some worms.",ASKR,ASKL,ASJR,ASJL,ASIR,ASIL,ASHR,ASHL,ASGR,ASGL,ASER,ASEL,AQR,ADLR,ADLL,ADFR,ADFL,ADER,ADEL,PQR,PHBL,PHAR,PHAL,PDER,PDEL,I4 neuron,FLPR,FLPL,PHBR,coelomocyte,nerve ring

However, these molecules are present at higher concentrations along the lateral region of the nerve cord, where synaptic junctions are abundant, relative to the medial region, which has many fewer synapses. The CLE-1 and NID-1 proteins appear to be present on different faces of the nerve cords relative to synaptic domains. NID-1 is present lateral to the region where synapses form, between the nerve cord and the muscle. CLE-1 is concentrated between the nerve cords and the pseudocoelomic space or overlying muscle arms, i.e., along the dorsal face of the ventral nerve cord and the ventral face of the dorsal nerve cord. Although CLE-1 and NID-1 are found overlapping or closely apposed to UNC-17 along the nerve cords, no consistent association of NID-1 or CLE-1 with UNC-17 puncta was observed, and vice versa. UNC-17 is not present at all of the presynaptic zones in the nerve cords. Similar distributions of CLE-1 and NID-1 relative to a marker for GABAergic presynaptic zones, juIs1, was observed. NID-1 and CLE-1 are also detected in nonsynaptic regions of the nerve cords, but generally at significantly lower levels."

The L2d and dauer larvae develop to the adult worm through the L3 and L4 larval stages, respectively, after the environment shifts to nutrient-rich conditions. pC3894G was continuously expressed in L3; however, it was rarely expressed in L4 and adults recovered from L2d larvae. The expression of the col-43::gfp fusion gene pCTL3894G was not detected due to the signal peptide produced by this fusion gene. The COL-43::GFP fusion protein could be transported into the extracellular matrix and diffuse to an undetectable level. Two promoter deletion constructs, pC1345G and pC1292R, were expressed in the hypodermal cells in the L2d and the L3 stage recovered from the L2d stage. These promoter deletion constructs were continuously expressed in the dauer, the L4 and the adult recovered from stage L2. The additional promoter deletion construct, pC610G was also expressed in the hypodermal cells in the L2d and recovered L3 stage, but was rarely expressed in the L4 stage and adult recovered from the L2d stage. These results indicate that two upstream regions of col-43, within 0.6 kb and from 0.6 kb to 1.3 kb, were required for the expression and up-regulation in the dauer cycle of col-43 expressions, respectively.

This peripheral staining was not of the Golgi complex that was visualized as discrete centralized puncta in coelomocytes.

GFP-CYB-1 fluorescence in fertilized embryos decreased for approximately 12 min and then remained fairly stable for approximately 10 min. These two periods of rapid GFP-CYB-1 turnover and of GFP-CYB-1 stability coincide with the timing of meiosis I and meiosis II, respectively. Twenty to twenty-four minutes after the start of GFP-CYB-1 proteolysis, at a time when meiosis II is expected to be completed, fluorescence levels decreased again and approached zero. Pronuclei were observed at the end of this period indicating that the embryos had entered interphase. In 9/9 unfertilized embryos, GFP-CYB-1 fluorescence decreased rapidly after exit from the spermatheca just as in fertilized embryos. This is consistent with the occurrence of anaphase I in unfertilized embryos, in contrast with unfertilized vertebrate eggs which arrest at metaphase with high levels of cyclin B. A significant difference was observed between the unfertilized and the fertilized embryos at the time that meiosis II was expected to be completed in fertilized embryos. The second phase of decreasing GFP-CYB-1 fluorescence intensity did not occur in unfertilized embryos to the extent observed in fertilized embryos. At 27 min after spermatheca exit, GFP-CYB-1 fluorescence intensity was 7 +/- 5% (n = 6) of the value in the proximal oocyte in fertilized embryos and 19 +/- 10% (n = 9) in unfertilized embryos. This difference was statistically significant (P = .001) indicating that cyclin B proteolysis is not complete in unfertilized embryos.

In the 2-cell stage embryo, the DAO-5 signal consists of 15-25 small dots of varying intensity distributed throughout each nucleus. Nucleolus-like structures were never observed at this early stage. The first appearance of a nucleolar structure occurs at the 6- to 8-cell stage, when larger spherical bodies (~0.5 mm in diameter) are immunodetected amidst the dot-like signals. Shortly after, the number of small dot-like signals that are detected decreases drastically (but some persist until later stages) and, except for the germline cell, all embryonic nuclei then harbor one or, in the vast majority, two distinct DAO- 5 or FIB-1 signals of equal size and intensity. This pattern remains broadly similar throughout embryogenesis, with the notable exception that intestinal nuclei often contain a single large DAO-5/FIB-1 positive nucleolus at later stages. It should be noted that at all embryonic stages examined, a substantial pool of diffuse nucleoplasmic DAO-5 was also detected. In the adult, the localization of DAO-5 was examined in more detail in the polyploid intestinal nuclei, which contain a large centrally-located nucleolus. In these nucleoli, the DAO-5 signal describes a hollow sphere that surrounds a DNA-poor core. In addition to being present in this portion of the nucleolus, DAO-5 is found in numerous small punctate structures throughout the nucleoplasm of intestinal nuclei.

All ten seam cells in newly hatched L1 larvae showed strong egl-18 expression. After their first division, egl-18::mCherry expression was asymmetric between the daughters, with stronger expression in the posterior daughters that maintain the seam cell fate. Expression in the anterior daughter faded after division, before the hypodermal daughters moved out of the seam cell line. During the L2 stage, several seam cells undergo a symmetric expansion division, generating two seam daughters and increasing the seam cell number from 10 to 16 (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977). In the early L2, strong symmetric expression of egl-18::mCherry was seen in both seam-fated daughters of these divisions. When these seam-fated daughters underwent their subsequent L2 and L3 stage asymmetric divisions, reporter expression faded in their anterior, hypodermal-fated daughters as observed in the L1 stage.

Additional analyses revealed that the downstream half (350 bp) of the 650-bp region was sufficient for vulval expression. Neither half of the 350-bp region (pYB16 and pYB19) resulted in vulval expression above the background, which suggests that both halves of the f350-bp region are important for vulval expression.

At higher resolution there was a periodicity to these lines that approximated the distance between the dense body adhesion sites. The ELP-1::GFP fluorescence slightly overlaps the edges of the dense bodies but is not superimposable with the dense bodies at this angle. These results indicate that ELP-1 is unlikely to be a component of the dense bodies. Double-stained muscle cells with anti-ELP-1 antibodies and a monoclonal antibody MH25 against PAT-3 shows that integrin and ELP-1 have overlapping staining patterns at this level of resolution. Because of the relatively impenetrable cuticle that surrounds the nematode, these worms were frozen and cracked open prior to antibody staining. In areas lacking dense bodies, ELP-1::GFP was sometimes lost. However most of the ELP-1::GFP was retained in a linear pattern. These results indicate that the membrane and dense bodies can be separated from the ELP-1::GFP."

Just prior to morphogenesis, reporter gene expression could be seen in all the major hypodermal cell nuclei. During formation of the comma stage, embryo reporter gene expression declined in the dorsal and ventral hypodermis but remained high in the lateral seam cells. The seam-cell expression of the reporter gene continued throughout morphogenesis to the pretzel stage although at lower levels. In addition, at the threefold stage of development high levels of expression were seen in a group of cells adjacent to the pharynx in a position consistent with neuronal cells of the retrovesicular ganglion. During postembryonic development relatively low levels of expression were maintained in seam cells from the L1 to the adult stage as were high levels of ELT-1 in neuronal cells of the retrovesicular ganglion. ELT-1 expression was also clearly apparent in several different groups of neuronal cell bodies and axons; those of the ventral cord were the most prominent. Expression was also seen in several neurons in which the axon extended from the ventral cord and encircled the pharynx just in front of the posterior bulb.The reporter gene also showed postembryonic expression in sex-specific structures.

Ce-emerin was not detected in cells undergoing spermiogenesis that had reached the stage of having condensed chromatin. However, we could not definitively conclude that emerin was absent from sperm, because sperm lack Ce-lamin (Liu et al., 2000) and therefore had no positive control for antibody access into these cells during staining. Nevertheless, the nearly ubiquitous positive staining seen for Ce-emerin throughout development and in adult animals was similar to that seen for human emerin, which is found in most cell types examined (Manilal et al., 1999)."

SP56 was first seen approximately 6 hr after the molt from L3 to L4 (3 hr, n = 17; 6 hr, n = 14; 10 hr, n = 19), where staining was limited to the proximal-most germ cells. As animals matured through the L4 stage, the SP56 domain expanded distally to include an increasing number of cells. Importantly, FOG-1 and SP56 were not present in the same cells at the same time. Instead, FOG-1 staining preceded SP56 staining in both time and space. For example, the proximal-most germ cells expressed FOG-1 in late L3 and early L4 ; those same cells expressed SP56 in mid-L4 (6 hr), when the FOG-1 domain had moved distally.

GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 were detected at the spindle asters and at the membranes between germ-precursor nuclei in the distal gonad arms. During the formation and maturation of oocytes, GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 localized diffusely to the cytoplasm and more prominently to the nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes, in particular to membranes between adjacent oocytes. Following fertilization and meiosis, GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 appeared at the duplicated centrosomes associated with the sperm pronucleus. GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 both became progressively more abundant at the spindle asters during the formation of the first mitotic spindle. Both proteins also localized diffusely around the kinetochore MTs in metaphase. Although the latter localization disappeared in early anaphase, GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 persisted at the spindle asters until chromosome decondensation in telophase. On completion of cell cleavage, GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 were detected only at the cell cortex and cytoplasm. This pattern of spindle-associated localizations was repeated during subsequent mitotic divisions.

The level of cortical localization of GPR-1/2 increased and became weakly enriched at the posterior pole of most embryos during anaphase. In some embryos with enriched posterior staining, GPR-1/2 also appeared to be slightly enriched at the anterior pole of the embryo, compared with lateral regions. GPR-1/2 asymmetry became more pronounced during cytokinesis and interphase of the two-cell stage. In the P1 blastomere during interphase, GPR-1/2 were highly enriched around the posterior pole of the cell, and were present at low levels uniformly around the cortex of AB. As the cell cycle progressed, GPR-1/2 asymmetry in P1 disappeared; GPR-1/2 were uniformly localized around the cortex through out prophase, metaphase and early anaphase.

The punctate localisation of CeHCF represented very specific and frequently quantitative colocalisation with mitochondria. This was observed with several independent mitochondrial markers for mitotracker, a mitochondrial specific dye. More diffuse cytoplasmic staining could sometimes be observed in addition to the cytoplasmic mitochondrial localisation, and in a significant fraction of cells (~25%) there was very little nuclear accumulation."

Nuclei that are in the earliest stages of chromosome condensation do not stain with mAb 6C4. Staining with mAb 6C4 was first observed in prophase nuclei that contain condensed chromosomes. At this stage, mAb 6C4 staining was observed as dots distributed throughout the nucleus; many of these dots colocalize with the chromosomes. These chromosome-associated dots are widely dispersed along the entire length of each chromosome. Later in prophase, mAb 6C4 stained structures located on opposite sides of each chromosome. In metaphase, when the chromosomes are aligned at the equatorial plane, chromosomes were oriented with each mAb 6C4 stained structure facing one centrosome. At anaphase, sister chromatids separated with the mAb 6C4 stained side on the poleward face of each sister chromatid. No mAb 6C4 staining was detectable by late anaphase. These results show that there is dynamic localization of the mAb 6C4 antigen to chromosomes throughout mitosis. mAb 6C4 Staining during meiosis During meiosis, C. elegans chromosomes lack a trilaminar kinetochore structure, and attachment to the meiotic spindle is mediated through the chromosome ends. No mAb 6C4 nuclear staining was detected in the mitotic region of the gonad of the hermaphrodite nor in oocytes arrested at diakinesis of prophase I. After fertilization, embryos exit prophase I arrest and undergo two consecutive rounds of division to form two polar bodies. Staining with mAb 6C4 was detected on meiotic chromosomes after fertilization and before first olar body formation.

It appears that most of the AB cells in the embryo stain, and what appears to be the cells of the C lineage. Some embryos exhibit staining in the two rows of nuclei that are the E lineage. All embryonic staining is very intense, and it spreads to the cytoplasm giving blue embryos, therefore obscuring the DAPI staining, making it difficult to count the number of cells in the embryos as each component begins expressing. This intense staining fades as the embryo ages, sometimes leaving blue comma stage embryos with no distinct nuclei staining. Hypodermal expression is seen in the 3 fold stage of embryogenesis and in young larvae which most probably are C-derived hyp-7 nuclei.

Frequently, HIM-8 foci have a crescent-shaped appearance, especially in the transition zone, as if the protein localizes to a patch along the nuclear surface.

Costaining with P-granule-specific antibodies revealed that the structures containing the cytoplasmic HIS-24 protein are not the P-granules. Cytoplasmic HIS-24 is characteristic for most developmental stages of the germ line, it is found in the mitotic region of the gonad, in the transition zone, in the meiotic region, and during all stages of oogenesis.

WBGene00001949,hlh-2,"Krause et al., 1997","CeE/DA can first be detected in both nuclei of 2-cell embryos. Staining persists apparently in all nuclei of the early embryo for the first 150-200 minutes of development (100-200 cells). By 270 minutes of development (approx. 350 cells) a dramatic change in antibody staining has occurred in which persistent staining is seen in progressively fewer blastomeres. Most, but not all, blastomeres that initially retain CeE/DA antibody staining at this stage are neurons or their immediate precursors. There are a few neuronal precursors that are located away from the neuronal clusters in the embryo (for example the postembryonic neuroblast W), for which antibody staining was not detected. Therefore, although persistent antibody staining is largely restricted to neurons or their precursors, not every such cell is antibody-positive. CeE/DA-antibody staining is transient for the majority of these cells, with the staining progressively lost as differentiation and morphogenesis occur. This is most clearly evident at the 1.5-fold stage of embryogenesis, in which a lateral view of the embryo shows staining in the head, ventral nerve cord and tail. As the embryo begins elongating, the level of CeE/DA-antibody staining decreases in these cells. Note that most of these cells are postmitotic. Although the majority of cells lose CeE/DA-antibody staining during the later half of embryogenesis, a small percentage of cells remain antibody-positive through the remainder of embryogenesis and after hatching. There are 14 of these continually staining cells in the head and seven more in the tail region. Of the 14 head cells, 5 are pharyngeal. The pharyngeal nuclei have been identified, as two pharyngeal muscle nuclei (pm5L and R) and three pharyngeal gland cell nuclei (g1P, g2L and R). The remaining nine CeE/DA antibody-positive cells in the head are outside of the pharynx and are located in the neuronal cluster between the nerve ring and the posterior pharyngeal bulb. There are four bilateral pairs of stained nuclei and one positive nucleus lying along the ventral mid-line. Using hlh-2::GFP reporter strains and DiI staining, three of the bilateral pairs of neurons have been identified as ADL (L and R) and ASH (L and R) and RIC (L and R). The large number of neurons in this area makes it difficult to identify unambiguously each of the remaining three CeE/DA antibody-positive cells. The seven tail cells with nuclei that remain CeE/DA antibody-positive throughout embryonic development include the two Q neuroblasts and five cells were tentatively identified as DVA (an interneuron), the bilateral pair of intestinal muscle cells, the anal depressor muscle and the anal sphincter muscle. The two intestinal and two anal muscle cells are postmitotic and are non-striated muscles.",pm5,ASHR,ASHL,RICR,RICL,ADLR,ADLL,AB,QR,QL,anal depressor muscle,gon_herm_dtc_P,gon_herm_dtc_A,g2R,g2L,g1P,Z3,Z2,DVA,gonad,uterine muscle,intestinal muscle,anal sphincter muscle,vulval muscle,ABarpaapa,ABalppapa,ABprpappp,ABplapaap,ABalpaaap,ABprpapp,ABaraapa,MSapaaa,ABarppap,ABarapaaa,ABaraaap,ABplaapaa,ABarpapap,MSpaap,ABplaapap,MSaaapp,MSaaaa,ABpraaapa,ABplaapp,Cpapp,MSapa,Caaaa,MSaapaa,ABprapppa,MSppaap,Caap,ABalapppp,ABalpappa,MSppaaa,ABprppapp,MSpaaa,ABalpaap,ABalppapp,ABprpppa,ABalppaa,ABplaappp,ABplpapaa,ABprapaaa,Cpapa,Cppaa,MSpapap,ABarapaap,ABaraappa,ABalaaap,ABprppppp,ABprppaa,ABplppaaa,Epl,ABarappa,ABaraapap,MSppppp,ABalppaap,Cpppa,ABplppap,MSpaaap,ABpraappa,MSapp,ABalaappa,ABarpppaa,MSapppa,Dpa,ABprpaapa,ABarppaap,ABprppppa,ABprapppp,ABalppppp,ABplppaap,Cpppp,ABpraapap,ABaraappp,ABplappap,MSapaap,MSppapp,ABplpaap,MSaaaaa,ABplpapa,ABprpappa,ABalpppp,ABplppapa,ABprppapa,ABplappa,Capp,ABplpaaaa,Eala,MSapppp,ABpraapaa,ABalppap,ABplpaapa,Caapa,MSappp,ABalppaaa,ABalaapa,ABalapapp,ABaraaaaa,ABplaaapp,ABalapaa,ABpraaaap,MSaaaap,MSpaaaa,ABarapapp,MSpappa,ABaraapp,ABalaaaar,ABalappa,MSaaap,Eara,ABprapaa,ABalappap,ABprpaaa,Cppa,ABplppaa,MSpppap,ABplpapap,ABprpppp,ABalpaapa,Cappp,ABarppppp,ABaraaapp,ABalpaaaa,Dpp,MSaappa,MSpapp,MSpaapp,Dap,ABprpapap,Cpaaa,ABalapaap,MSppppa,ABprappap,ABplpppaa,ABalapaaa,ABplpappa,MSapaa,ABprpppap,MSapapa,ABarppapp,ABalappp,MSappap,ABarpppap,ABprpaap,ABprpapa,MSpappp,Caaap,Cppp,ABprappa,ABpraappp,ABarpappa,ABprpaaaa,ABalpapap,Daa,ABprapapp,MSaaapa,ABarppppa,ABpraapa,ABarpappp,Capap,ABaraaaap,ABplpaaap,ABalapapa,ABplpaaa,ABalppppa,Epra,ABarapppa,ABarapap,ABpraapp,ABprppap,ABplaaaaa,ABprappaa,MSpapaa,ABplppppa,ABplppapp,ABaraaaa,Ear,ABplappaa,ABalappaa,ABalaapaa,MSppap,ABarpapaa,ABalpapaa,ABplpappp,ABarpaaa,ABalpppaa,ABprppaap,MSpppp,ABplapapp,ABplpapp,ABplpaapp,ABplpppa,ABplapap,MSaapp,ABalaaaa,Eal,ABpraaaa,Capa,ABprpapaa,MSppa,ABalpappp,ABarppaa,ABplappp,ABplapaaa,MSapap,ABalapppa,ABplaaap,MSpppa,ABprpaaap,MSapapp,Eplp,ABarpaaap,Eprp,MSappaa,ABprapapa,Da,ABarpapp,ABarapaa,Cpaa,ABarpaap,ABplaappa,ABarappp,ABarppapa,MSppaa,ABarpppp,MSaapap,ABpraaap,MSaapa,Ealp,Epr,ABprpppaa,ABalaapp,MSpaapa,ABalpaaa,ABalapap,Caaa,ABarapppp,ABarappap,ABalpapa,ABplppppp,ABprppaaa,ABplaaaa,ABaraaapa,Cpaap,ABarpapa,ABprpaapp,ABalpapp,MSppapa,ABplaapa,ABarpaapp,ABprapaap,ABplaaaap,ABalaapap,Cpap,ABpraaaaa,ABarpaaaa,ABalpppap,ABarapapa,Earp,ABplpppp,ABalpppa,ABaraapaa,ABplapppp,Epla,ABarappaa,Cappa,ABplpppap,Capaa,MSpapa,ABplapapa,ABprapap,ABplaaapa,ABalaappp,ABalaaapa,ABarpppa,ABplapppa,Cppap,ABprappp,ABalaaapp,ABalpaapp,MSppp,MSaappp,ABpraaapp,MSappa,Dp,Caapp,ABalaaaal,ABplapaa,MSpppaa,ABarppaaa,Psub1

This expression is undetectable by the early L1 larval stage. The most conspicuous expression during L1 is within the P cell lineages. Specifically, hlh-3 is expressed in the ectodermal-like P cells, and expression persists in the primary and secondary neural precursors of the P cell lineages. In addition, it appears to be expressed in all 53 of the resulting postmitotic motor neurons. Expression in most of these neurons is undetectable by the L2 larval stage. It is worth noting here that these neurons represent 77% of all motor neurons mediating locomotion. hlh-3 is also expressed in the HSNs and ventral type C (VC) motor neurons throughout larval development. At hatching, expression in the HSNs is weak, but peaks at the L3 larval stage and persists until the late L4 larval stage. Expression in the VCs also peaks during L3. Overall, hlh-3 appears to be expressed in all neural precursors. Based on expression in the P cell lineages, expression generally persists through terminal cell division and disappears from postmitotic neurons shortly thereafter.

At approximately the time adherens junctions begin to form in the hypodermis, HMP-1 protein accumulates to high levels along the apical margins of all hypodermal cells (all hypodermal staining lies within a 1-um focal plane near the cell surface). During migration of ventral hypodermal cells, HMP-1 antiserum staining is not detected at the leading edges of these cells. HMP-1 becomes localized to the ventral margins of these cells as they contact contralateral cells at the ventral midline. During body elongation, the HMP-1 antiserum stains predominantly the apical margins of all hypodermal, pharyngeal, and intestinal cells, as does the mAbMH27 antiserum.

In the spermatheca of hermaphrodites, HSP12s are localized in sperm. At higher magnification, the distribution of HSP12 cytoplasmic staining in sperm cells is seen to be spherically symmetrical. In males, spermatids are stored in the seminal vesicle, and most sperm cells mature following ejaculation; the extensive labelling of HSP12 in male germ cells therefore indicates localization of this smHSP to spermatids and perhaps spermatocytes. Cells in the mitotic region of the male gonad, however, are not labelled. In hermaphrodites, HSP12s are also expressed in a subset of vulval muscle cells (A9A12).

In distal arms clusters of fine puncta were associated with each germ cell, as previously reported for INX-14 and INX-22 expression (Govindan et al. 2009). INX-8/9 (antibodies raised against INX-8 shown to cross-react with INX-9) INX-8::GFP and INX-9::GFP were expressed in the distal tip cell (DTC) in addition to the somatic sheath. In the DTC, INX-8/9, INX-8::GFP and INX-9::GFP associated with long processes that extended from the DTC proximally, especially those running between germ cells and intercalating among them. At the distal limit of sheath cell coverage of germ cells, longer formations sometimes appeared associated with the apparent edge of the sheath cells. At the loop region of the gonad arm, individual puncta appeared in larger, higher-density aggregates. In the proximal arm puncta size was more variable, with many appearing to be considerably larger than the fine puncta seen in the distal arm. The expression levels of INX-8, INX-9 appeared higher in the proximal gonad. Throughout the gonad the localization patterns of INX-8::GFP and INX-9::GFP were indistinguishable. In addition to gonadal expression, antibody staining of whole mounts suggested that INX-8/9 may be expressed in some pharyngeal and a few other head neurons (T. Starich, unpublished results), but because the antibody reacted primarily with processes and not cell bodies we did not attempt to identify these neurons. Male gonads were examined and found to express INX-8, -9, -14, -21 and -22 as well. Presumptive gap junctions forming between both male distal tip cells and germ cells were detected with antibodies specific to INX-8/9, INX-14, INX-21, and INX-22. INX-8::GFP and INX-9::GFP were both expressed in the DTCs. No expression was detected in the transition zone, but innexin expression appeared to outline individual germ cells in the pachytene region. All 5 innexins are also expressed in the regions occupied by differentiated spermatocytes and sperm, with evidence of puncta formation. Expression of INX-9::GFP visualized somatic coverage of spermatids, probably by cells of the seminal vesicle, but somatic coverage of germ cells in the pachytene region of the male gonad has not been described. Examination of earlier developmental stages showed that all five innexins are expressed in the primordial gonad, consisting of somatic gonadal precursors Z1 and Z4 and the primordial germ cells Z2 and Z3. Early larval expression patterns differ from adults in that distinct, well-defined puncta potentially corresponding to gap junctions are less clearly discernible. In L2-L4 larval stages, germ cell innexins appear to be continually expressed, and somatic innexins are expressed predominantly in the DTC. In late L2 and early L3 stages, as the gonad arm lengthens, the migrating DTC seems to trail a process behind it that maintains contact with the germ cell compartment. The DTC appears to form gap junctions with germ cells at both long external processes and processes that intercalate between germ cells. At this time a second, more proximal focus of somatic innexin expression was sometimes detected. Though this second focus might represent extensions from the DTC, expression of inx-9::gfp suggested that other somatic cells besides the DTC might be involved. By the late L3 stage, the DTC no longer appears to be in contact with all of the germ cells. To better understand the contacts between germ cells and the DTC, we examined early L4-stage animals by TEM. We observed several processes trailing behind the DTC cell body on the outer edge of the germ line, as well as extensions that dig deeply between germ cells. The immunofluorescence results suggest that gap junctions form between the DTC and germ cells at both the outer and inner DTC arms. The inx-8 promoter was fused to mCherry, and inx-8p::mCherry was expressed during larval development in most or all of the somatic gonad cells derived from Z1 and Z4, including the DTC, sheath/spermathecal precursors and uterine cell precursors. We conclude that although expression of INX-8/9 appears to be strongest in the DTC during larval development, other somatic gonad cells may also express INX-8/9 at this time.",Z4,Z3,Z2,Z1,gonad,pharyngeal neuron,gonadal sheath cell,head neuron,sperm,spermatocyte,DTC

In distal arms clusters of fine puncta were associated with each germ cell, as previously reported for INX-14 and INX-22 expression (Govindan et al. 2009). INX-14, -21 and -22 colocalized to puncta associated with long processes that extended from the DTC proximally, especially those running between germ cells and intercalating among them. At the distal limit of sheath cell coverage of germ cells, longer formations sometimes appeared associated with the apparent edge of the sheath cells. At the loop region of the gonad arm, individual puncta appeared in larger, higher-density aggregates. In the proximal arm puncta size was more variable, with many appearing to be considerably larger than the fine puncta seen in the distal arm. Although all innexins appeared to colocalize, INX-21 differed from the other innexins in that its expression level was relatively higher in the distal gonad compared to the proximal gonad. In contrast, the expression levels of INX-8, INX-9, INX-14, INX-22 appeared higher in the proximal gonad. Male gonads were examined and found to express INX-8, -9, -14, -21 and -22 as well. Presumptive gap junctions forming between both male distal tip cells and germ cells were detected with antibodies specific to INX-8/9, INX-14, INX-21, and INX-22. All 5 innexins are also expressed in the regions occupied by differentiated spermatocytes and sperm, with evidence of puncta formation. Examination of earlier developmental stages showed that all five innexins are expressed in the primordial gonad, consisting of somatic gonadal precursors Z1 and Z4 and the primordial germ cells Z2 and Z3. In a few serendipitous cases expression of INX-22 was detected prior to hatching, in pretzel-stage embryos. Early larval expression patterns differ from adults in that distinct, well-defined puncta potentially corresponding to gap junctions are less clearly discernible. In L2-L4 larval stages, germ cell innexins appear to be continually expressed, and somatic innexins are expressed predominantly in the DTC. In late L2 and early L3 stages, as the gonad arm lengthens, the migrating DTC seems to trail a process behind it that maintains contact with the germ cell compartment. The DTC appears to form gap junctions with germ cells at both long external processes and processes that intercalate between germ cells. At this time a second, more proximal focus of somatic innexin expression was sometimes detected. Though this second focus might represent extensions from the DTC, expression of inx-9::gfp suggested that other somatic cells besides the DTC might be involved. By the late L3 stage, the DTC no longer appears to be in contact with all of the germ cells. To better understand the contacts between germ cells and the DTC, we examined early L4-stage animals by TEM.

WBGene00002285,let-7,"Van et al., 2011","Fluorescence was observed at the end of the L1 stage in transgenic worms that express GFP fused to the pri-let-7B start site. Detection of GFP mRNA, driven by both let-7 promoter A and B sequences in the transgenic worms, mirrored that of endogenous let-7 primary transcripts, indicating that expression of let-7 is repressed largely at the transcriptional level from embryogenesis until the late L1 stage. Consistent with the reporter analysis, pri-let-7  was first observed during the late L1 stage. We detected all three pri-let-7 isoforms, and coordinate expression of these isoforms oscillated throughout development. The low levels of pri-let-7 at most mid-larval time points and the slight shifts in the timing of pri-let-7 expression between experiments indicate that expression of endogenous pri-let-7 transcripts is dynamic, and that even slight changes in culture conditions can affect the rate of development and thus pri-let-7 expression. GFP mRNA levels of the let-7 promoter reporter oscillated with a frequency identical to that of endogenous pri-let-7 expression, suggesting that transcriptional mechanisms largely control the cycling pattern of pri-let-7 expression.  Consistent with previous reports, pre- and mature let-7 RNAs were undetectable until the L3 stage. In the L3 and L4 stages, levels of pre-let-7 oscillated in parallel to those of pri-let-7, while mature let-7 accumulated to a relatively constant level."
WBGene00002285,let-7,"Kai, Finnegan,  Huang, & Pasquinelli, 2013","let-7 primary transcripts are first detected at the end of the first larval stage and exhibit pulses of expression near the molt of each larval stage.  Both of the plet-7::GFP constructs drove temporally regulated expression, initially observed at the end of the first larval stage (L1). Starting in late L1 (~10 h at 25C), robust GFP was seen in muscle and neuronal cells in the head, including the nerve ring. Midway through L2, GFP accumulated in the neurons and muscle cells of the tail, body wall muscle (BWM), and ventral nerve cord (VNC). Beginning in L3, all transgenic lines began to express GFP in vulva precursor cells. After the onset of GFP expression in a particular tissue, it was maintained until adults became gravid with embryos (~52 h at 25 C). GFP was not detected in the germ line. Although plet-7A::GFP and plet-7B::GFP transgenics showed similar spatio-temporal expression patterns in most cell types, they were not entirely overlapping. In hypodermal and seam cells, the plet-7B::GFP reporter produced a robust GFP signal at the L3 stage. However, plet-7A::GFP animals exhibited only weak, transient expression of GFP in the hypodermal cells beginning at the L3 stage.

Once transcriptionally activated, Plin-4::GFP-pest and Plet-7::GFP-pest reporters peak in expression by 1820 hours and diminish with similar kinetics. For animals expressing the Plet-7::GFP-pest reporter GFP-pest expression was monitored for longer periods after release from L1 arrest. Consistent with the highly pulsatile nature of this expression pattern, GFP-pest expression was reinitiated at 30 hours, which correlates with the later portions of the L2 stage. While transcriptional activation of the Pmir-1::GFP-pest reporter was also initiated at 14 hours post-L1 arrest, the peak of Pmir-1::GFPpest expression occurred at a later time point, and diminished with slower kinetics, as compared to Plin-4::GFP-pest and Plet- 7::GFP-pest expression.The majority of animals which harbor the Plin-4::GFP-pest transgene cease GFP-pest expression by L3 ecdysis and resume expression by the mid-L4 stage. The pulse of Plin-4::GFP-pest expression at the L4 stage extends through the early portion of young adulthood and completely overlaps with the lethargus period in all animals. Plet-7::GFP-pest expression followed a similar pattern. However, GFP-pest expression was more variable at the L3-to-L4 transition and L4-specific induction of this transgene was primarily restricted to the lethargus period. In contrast to the expression profiles of the lin-4 and let-7 reporters, induction of Pmir-1::GFP-pest expression began during, or immediately after, L3 ecdysis and persisted into the L4 stage. A second pulse of Pmir-1::GFP-pest expression completely overlapped with the L4 lethargus period and continued into early adulthood. Collectively, these results suggest that the expression patterns of lin-4, let-7 and mir-1 are dynamic throughout development and that the cyclical transcription of these miRNAs is mediated by their cognate promoter sequences."

While transcriptional activation of the Pmir-1::GFP-pest reporter was also initiated at 14 hours post-L1 arrest, the peak of Pmir-1::GFPpest expression occurred at a later time point, and diminished with slower kinetics, as compared to Plin-4::GFP-pest and Plet- 7::GFP-pest expression.The majority of animals which harbor the Plin-4::GFP-pest transgene cease GFP-pest expression by L3 ecdysis and resume expression by the mid-L4 stage. The pulse of Plin-4::GFP-pest expression at the L4 stage extends through the early portion of young adulthood and completely overlaps with the lethargus period in all animals. Plet-7::GFP-pest expression followed a similar pattern. However, GFP-pest expression was more variable at the L3-to-L4 transition and L4-specific induction of this transgene was primarily restricted to the lethargus period. In contrast to the expression profiles of the lin-4 and let-7 reporters, induction of Pmir-1::GFP-pest expression began during, or immediately after, L3 ecdysis and persisted into the L4 stage. A second pulse of Pmir-1::GFP-pest expression completely overlapped with the L4 lethargus period and continued into early adulthood. Collectively, these results suggest that the expression patterns of lin-4, let-7 and mir-1 are dynamic throughout development and that the cyclical transcription of these miRNAs is mediated by their cognate promoter sequences."
WBGene00002993,lin-4," Perales, King,  Aguirre-Chen, & Hammell, 2014","Expression of the Plin-4::GFP-pest reporter peaked in hyp7 and seam cells at the mid- and late-L3 stage and then again at the late-L4 stage. In addition, the majority of animals exhibited a cessation of hyp7 and seam cell Plin-4::GFP-pest expression immediately after L4 ecdysis. In contrast, Plin-4::GFP-pest expression in muscle cells displayed a different transcriptional profile. In the majority of animals, expression of GFP-pest in muscles peaked at L3 ecdysis, gradually diminished throughout the remainder of the L4 stage, and increased again at the young adult stage. These results suggest that, while lin-4 is dynamically expressed once each larval stage, its promoter activity may be differentially regulated in distinct tissues.",muscle cell,hyp7 syncytium,seam cell
WBGene00002994,lin-5,"Lorson, Horvitz, & van, 2000","LIN-5 was present at the meiotic spindles in the fertilized egg during meiosis I and II. Staining associated with the maternal pronucleus disappeared after completion of meiosis and LIN-5 became localized at the duplicated centrosomes that adjoined the paternal pronucleus. LIN-5 remained localized at the centrosomes until completion of the first mitotic division. In all subsequent mitoses, LIN-5 was associated with the centrosomes and detectable after separation of the centrosomes in prophase until decondensation of chromosomes in telophase. LIN-5 was also diffusely present in the cytoplasm and at two other locations; LIN-5 appeared microtubule-associated in cells with metaphase-aligned chromosomes. This localization was limited to the region between the poles and did not overlap with DNA staining. Therefore, it appeared to reflect specific association of LIN-5 with kinetochore microtubules. LIN-5 was diffusely present at the cell cortex in most embryonic cells from the two-cell stage onward. During the larval stages, LIN-5 localized to the centrosomes from prophase to telophase and to the cell periphery in late mitosis. In adult hermaphrodites, mitosis is restricted to germ presursor cells in the distal ends of the gonad. LIN-5 was detected at the centrosomes of such cells and, in addition, diffuse cytoplasmic LIN-5 staining was detected in oocytes. Strong membrane-associated staining was detected in the gonad at all stages of development."
WBGene00002994,lin-5,"Srinivasan, Fisk,  Xu, &  van den Heuvel, 2003","During all mitotic divisions examined, GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 were present at the cell cortex and spindle asters. GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 were detected at the spindle asters and at the membranes between germ-precursor nuclei in the distal gonad arms. During the formation and maturation of oocytes, GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 localized diffusely to the cytoplasm and more prominently to the nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes, in particular to membranes between adjacent oocytes. Following fertilization and meiosis, GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 appeared at the duplicated centrosomes associated with the sperm pronucleus. GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 both became progressively more abundant at the spindle asters during the formation of the first mitotic spindle. Both proteins also localized diffusely around the kinetochore MTs in metaphase. Although the latter localization disappeared in early anaphase, GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 persisted at the spindle asters until chromosome decondensation in telophase. On completion of cell cleavage, GPR-1/GPR-2 and LIN-5 were detected only at the cell cortex and cytoplasm. This pattern of spindle-associated localizations was repeated during subsequent mitotic divisions. The cortical localization appeared enriched between blastomeres, especially the cortical staining of LIN-5."
WBGene00002994,lin-5,"Park & Rose, 2008","During prophase of the first mitosis in centration and rotation stage embryos, LIN-5 did not appear enriched at the cortex relative to the underlying cytoplasm. However, the anterior cortex and cytoplasm stained more intensely for LIN-5. Although both cortical and cytoplasmic LIN-5 intensities were somewhat discontinuous, most prophase embryos exhibited clear asymmetries overall: The highest levels of cortical LIN-5 staining were at the anterior from 0% to 30% egg length (33/38 cortices, n = 19 embryos; note that in some embryos the upper and lower cortex showed different patterns and thus the number of cortices, rather than embryos, was scored). In these embryos, LIN-5 staining intensities began to decrease at about 40% egg length. LIN-5 cytoplasmic intensities showed similar anterior enrichment and the traces closely matched those of cortical levels in most cases (30/38 traces). The differences between anterior and posterior intensities are statistically significant. The averaged plot also shows a bipolar appearance rather than a simple anterior to posterior gradient: the region from 50% to 70% egg length had the lowest average staining intensities."
WBGene00002994,lin-5," van der Voet et al., 2009","LIN-5 and ASPM-1 were found to co-localize at the meiotic spindle and mitotic spindle poles. LIN-5 also localizes diffusely between the poles of the metaphase spindle and at the cell cortex.

Generally, RFP::RAB-10-containing clusters were less abundant and larger than LIN-10::GFP-containing clusters. Close association between RFP::RAB-10 and LIN-10::GFP was sometimes observed in neurites, as indicated by partial overlap between LIN-10::GFP and RFP::RAB-10 clusters. ~20% of LIN-10::GFP puncta were associated with a cluster of RFP::RAB-10, whereas ~40% of RFP::RAB-10 clusters were associated with one or more LIN-10::GFP puncta.

At the L1 stage, lin-12(1in_1408) was expressed in all Pn.p cells. Some unidentified cells in the head and tail regions were also gfp-positive at this stage. By the early L2 stage, lin-12(1in_1408)   expression remained strong only in the P(3-8).p cells. Unlike the other Pn.p cells, they remain unfused with the hypodermal syncytium, thereby retaining their competence to differentiate into a vulval cell type. After vulval induction at the early L3 stage, lin-12(1in_1408) was strongly expressed in P5.p and P7.p, the two VPCs        that adopt 2nd vulval fates, but weakly detectable in the other VPCs, P(3-4,6,8).p. As shown earlier (Wilkinson and Greenwald, 1995;    276 Levitan and Greenwald, 1998), lin-12 expression remained on in the P5.p and P7.p granddaughters by the late L3 stage. In addition to the P5.p and P7.p descendants, we found obvious fluorescence in the daughters of other VPCs, and even in the P6.p granddaughters [the daughters of P(3,4,8).p fuse with the hypodermis].       Nevertheless, expression of lin-12(1in_1408) was constantly intense in the P5.p and P7.p lineages, as compared with other VPC lineages. At the L2 and early L3 stages, lin-12(1in_1408) is also expressed in the two AC/VU precursors. Later, when lin-12(1in_1408) expression became increased in P5.p and P7.p relative to the other VPCs, transgene activity was seen in the presumptive VU cell, but not in the AC. During the L4 stage, expression of lin-12(1in_1408) was gradually      lost from the P6.p lineage; only the P(5,7).p descendants retained      GFP fluorescence in the developing vulval tissue. It is worth to note that lin-12(1in_1408) was also active in certain hypodermal and intestinal cells throughout larval development, presumably due to background expression of the vector. In adult hermaphrodites, lin-12(1in_1408) expression could not be  detected. The only exception was presented by a few     unidentified cells in the posterior body part, probably due to background expression.",head,tail,ventral uterine precursor,P3.p,P4.p,P5.p,P6.p,P7.p,P8.p,Z1.ppp,Z4.aaa,vulval precursor cell,ventral cord blast cell

Intense nuclear staining was observed in the hypodermal blast cells H1, H2, V1-V6 and T and in all of the intestinal (E) cells and weaker staining was observed in both neuroblasts Q1 and Q2, in the mesoblast M cell and in P cells (P1/2, P3/4 and P5/6). During L1, staining is seen in the progeny of the hypodermal blast cells H1, H2 V1-V6 and T and in all of the intestinal (E) cells.

In early one-cell-stage embryos, LIS-1 is typically detected within pronuclei during late prophase, before NEBD would be apparent by DIC microscopy. In favourable specimens, LIS-1 can also be detected at the nuclear periphery during late prophase (two-cell-stage embryo) as well as in the vicinity of chromosomes during prometaphase. LIS-1 is depleted from the centres of microtubule asters during prometaphase, whereas it is enriched throughout the spindle during metaphase and early anaphase. During late anaphase and telophase, LIS-1 staining diminishes on the spindle but becomes enriched in the vicinity of the microtubule asters. Moreover, LIS-1 enrichment becomes apparent at the cell cortex at this stage. The discrete subcellular distributions of LIS-1 are typically more readily detectable in subsequent cell cycles. This is especially true of the nuclear enrichment in prophase, of the spindle enrichment in metaphase and of the cortical localization. Whereas foci of LIS-1 colocalize with the plus end of some astral microtubules, this is not always the case, and many LIS-1 foci are found throughout the microtubule lattice. Therefore, C. elegans LIS-1 is not detected strictly at the plus end of microtubules."

WBGene00003048,lit-1," Takeshita &  Sawa, 2005","In the progeny of many cells, the nuclear level of WRM-1::GFP and GFP::LIT-1 was higher in the posterior daughters than in the anterior ones; this observation included hypodermal cells (T, V, and P cells), neuroblasts (QL and QR), and mesodermal cells (Mdr and Mvr). The asymmetric nuclear localization of LIT-1 is also reported in embryos. Weak punctate fluorescence was often detected at the anterior side of some cells before their division, for both GFP::LIT-1 and WRM-1::GFP. The asymmetric localization of GFP::LIT-1 and WRM-1::GFP was more clearly observed in seam cells (Vn.p), especially in the V5.p cell at the end of the L1 stage, when the expression of these genes was higher. Punctate fluorescence was clearly visible near the cell membrane in the anterior half of the cells. The asymmetric cortical localization was also observed during the mitosis of the V5.p cell. No asymmetry in the cytoplasmic localization of WRM-1 or LIT-1 was observed before or during cell division. At telophase, their localization near the anterior cortex and in the newly formed posterior nucleus was observed. Although WRM-1::GFP was nearly undetectable in the anterior nucleus after the V5.p division, it was clearly detected in the anterior nucleus at telophase, suggesting that the WRM-1 protein is exported out of the anterior nucleus during late telophase. These results indicate that WRM-1 and LIT-1 are asymmetrically localized to the anterior cortex before and during division and to the posterior nucleus after the division of many cells during post-embryonic development."

LIT-1::GFP was barely detected in the early and middle stages of each larval stage. LIT-1::GFP was strongly detected at late period within each larval stage.

The exception to rim staining was near the spindle poles, where Ce-lamin staining became progressively weaker starting in prometaphase, with a large gap at both poles during early anaphase. This local disruption of lamina integrity was consistent with mechanical puncturing by spindle microtubules, as seen in other organisms. Elsewhere, the lamina remained apparently intact through early anaphase and was removed only during mid-late anaphase. In later embryos (30 cells), the lamina appeared to disassemble more extensively at earlier stages (e.g., prometaphase), as deduced from higher levels of cytoplasmic staining at earlier stages of mitosis.

In contrast, during the early stages of neurodegeneration, lysosomes enlarge and localize close to the nucleus. As neurodegeneration progresses, lysosomes fuse to surround an internally vacuolated structure. This encapsulated vacuole is likely the swollen nucleus of the dying neuron. A portion of LMP-1 localizes to the plasma membrane. Lysosomes remain confined around the distended nucleus during necrotic cell death. As neurodegeneration proceeds, the nucleus migrates to the periphery of the cell and condenses.

Early in the L1 stage, expression was seen in H0, H1, and H2, in the anterior V cells, and in the T cells. Weak expression was also seen in hypodermal nuclei in the head and the tail, including those in hyp5, hyp6, hyp8, hyp9, and hyp10. Expression was not seen at this stage, however, in the P cells or in nuclei in the hyp7 syncytium. After division of H1, both H1.a, a seam cell, and H1.p, which joins hyp7, expressed gfp. Likewise, after division of V1V4 both the anterior daughters (which join hyp7) and the posterior daughters (which remain seam cells) expressed gfp. This pattern was repeated at each of the larval molts with the result that in adult worms, all descendents of H1, H2, and V1V4 expressed gfp. At the end of the L1 stage, V5.p could be seen to express gfp but not V5.a, which is a neuroblast. In the P cell lineages, expression was first seen toward the end of the L1 stage in P1.p, P2.p, P9.p, P10.p, and P11.p nuclei. These cells fuse with hyp7 during the L1 stage. Expression of gfp was not seen, on the other hand, in the daughters of P3 to P8 or P12 (all of which remain separate from hyp7).

This premature relocalization was blocked by CDK-1 and MAT-1 depletion. Authors concluded that GFP:MBK-2 relocalizes from the cortex to the cytoplasm in a two-step process linked to progression past metaphase I and possibly to meiotic exit."

WBGene00003156,mcm-4," Korzelius et al., 2011","By antibody staining, MCM-4 was found to be expressed in dividing cells during all stages of development in wild-type animals. Embryos showed the highest levels of MCM-4 expression, in agreement with the fact that more than half of the somatic cells are formed during embryogenesis. Even dauer larvae that had been arrested in cell division for 2 weeks still contained detectable MCM-4 protein levels. These results suggest that a pool of MCM-4 is retained during prolonged periods of quiescence, so that MCM-4 might function in the re-initiation of DNA synthesis when conditions improve. Immunostaining of wild-type animals for MCM-4 showed strong nuclear staining in the gonad, embryos and postembryonic lineages. MCM-4 was detectable in sperm and accumulated during oocyte maturation in the nucleus but did not show overlap with the condensed chromosomes in diakinesis of meiotic prophase. MCM-4 was not chromatin-associated during MeiosisI of the fertilized oocyte, and the first polar body did not contain MCM-4. This finding is consistent with the absence of S phase between Meiosis I and -II. The second polar body and maternal pronucleus received some MCM-4. Subsequently, embryonic cells in interphase showed strong nuclear staining. In prophase, MCM-4 localization did not overlap with the condensing chromosomes. Upon nuclear envelope degradation, MCM-4 became diffusely localized throughout the cell and clearly did not co-localize with the metaphase-aligned chromosomes. MCM-4 remained cytoplasmic at the onset of anaphase; however, chromatin association became apparent in late anaphase. These data show that chromosome association of MCM-4 is tightly controlled, consistent with origin licensing taking place at the end of mitosis and disappearing during S phase. Similar observations were made during larval divisions. Matching the MCM-4::mCherry reporter, endogenous MCM-4 expression was detectable prior to and during mitosis. Staining of synchronized L1 animals revealed the timing of MCM-4 expression, which in general preceded mitosis by 12 h. After 5 h of L1 development at 20 C, MCM-4 immunostaining was predominantly detected in the epithelial seam cells, Q neuroblast daughters and gonad primordium. The somatic gonad precursor cells Z1 and Z4 showed nuclear staining, while the mitotically arrested germline precursor cells Z2 and Z3 showed diffuse cytoplasmic staining. At 6 hours of L1 development, the mesoblast (M) also stained strongly as well as the most anterior ventral cord precursors cells (W, P1 and P2). Subsequently at 7 h, additional P cells showed nuclear MCM-4 expression, which became apparent prior to migration of the nucleus into the ventral nerve cord. At 8 h of L1 development, the intestinal nuclei showed MCM-4 expression, which preceded nuclear division by at least 4 h. At subsequent time points, daughter cells that continued division, such as the Pn.a and M descendants, retained strong nuclear staining. L2 animals stained at 16 h of larval development showed strong MCM-4 expression in the gonad, the H1.a, H2.p, V1-6.p and T.ap seam cells and, weakly, the intestinal nuclei (data not shown). Importantly, MCM-4 staining did not overlap with DNA in prophase and metaphase, while in late anaphase co-localization with the chromosomes was clearly detectable. Similar to our observations with the MCM-4::mCherry reporter, we could not detect any asymmetry in MCM-4 segregation. Thus, even if only one daughter cell continued cell division, both daughters received a similar amount of MCM-4in mitosis. Furthermore, the MCM-4protein became undetectable during quiescence, i.e. the P3.p-P8.p daughter cells that resume DNA replication in the L3 stage did not show detectable expression in the L2 stage. Altogether, our reporter gene and antibody staining analysis show that MCM-4 is dynamically expressed and localized during larval development as well as during different phases of the cell cycle.",Z4,Z3,Z2,Z1,W cell,gonad,seam cell,intestine,P1,P2,sperm,TL.ap,TR.ap,embryonic cell,H1L.a,H1R.a,H2L.p,H2R.p,V1L.p,V1R.p,V2L.p,V2R.p,V3L.p,V3R.p,V4L.p,V4R.p,V5L.p,V5R.p,V6L.p,V6R.p,M lineage cell,P lineage cell,Q lineage cell

During meiosis, MEL-28 is present on the nuclear periphery in the oocyte, on the condensing oocyte chromosomes, and on meiotic chromosomes (polar bodies) in the fertilized embryo. During interphase of the first mitotic cycle, MEL-28 is present at the nuclear periphery and as puncta within the nucleus. On the nuclear periphery, MEL-28 localization overlaps with the interior rim of nuclear-envelope marker mAB414 (which in C. elegans recognizes primarily nucleoporins NPP-9 [Nup358] and NPP-10 [Nup98/96]. As the pronuclei meet, each nucleus shows a dynamic reorganization of the internal puncta. By metaphase, the scattered dots resolve into pairs of stripes on either side of the metaphase plate, a pattern indicative of holocentric kinetochore localization."
WBGene00003210,mel-28," Galy,  Askjaer,  Franz,  Lopez-Iglesias, & Mattaj, 2006","MEL-28 was expressed in embryos as well as in all larval stages and in adults. Immunolocalization of MEL-28 in several tissues revealed a nuclear-rim localization typical for NE or NPC proteins. MEL-28 was localized to chromatin during mitosis. The localization of MEL-28 within the NE was then analyzed by immuno-gold TEM. As expected, the highest density of gold particles was observed at the NE, but particles were also observed in the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. Particles found in the cytoplasm most likely reflect a cross reactivity of the MEL-28 antibody because a similar density of gold particles was observed in the cytoplasm of mel-28(t1684) embryos. No gold particles were observed in the nuclei or at the nuclear periphery of mutant embryos. Of the particles associated with the NE in the wild-types, 95.0% (152/160) were found at NPCs. No accumulation at the outer nuclear membrane was detected. MEL-28 enrichment at NPCs was also detected in gonad nuclei. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that MEL-28 began to localize to the condensing chromosomes before complete disappearance of mAb414 staining from the nuclear rim at prophase and began to appear as two lines parallel to the metaphase plate. During late anaphase, MEL-28 signal colocalized with the decondensing chromosomes, and the mAb414 signal reaccumulated to the reforming NE during telophase. Immunolocalization of MEL-28 in embryos expressing GFP-HIM-10 revealed an overlapping localization of both proteins parallel to the metaphase plate within the mitotic spindle. Only a few kinetochore microtubules remained visible after 30 s on ice, and after 60 s, microtubules were not detectable. At both time points, MEL-28 staining remained clearly visible along the condensed and aligned chromosomes, indicating that MEL-28 localizes to kinetochores during mitosis. MEL-28 localization changes rapidly at late anaphase and telophase. MEL-28 initially spreads over the entire chromatin surface then rapidly relocalizes to the NE. This distribution would be consistent with MEL-28's playing a role in the interactions that occur between chromatin and the assembling NE and NPCs late in mitosis."
WBGene00003210,mel-28," Galy,  Askjaer,  Franz,  Lopez-Iglesias, & Mattaj, 2006","To investigate the dynamics of MEL-28 in living embryos, GFP-MEL-28 was compared with known NE proteins fused to G/YFP using confocal time-lapse microscopy. Like endogenous MEL-28, which was localized by immunostaining, GFP-MEL-28 was mostly concentrated at the nuclear periphery but was also detected in the nucleoplasm and associated with condensing chromosomes when cells entered mitosis. This pattern was indistinguishable from that of YFP-Nup107, which also localizes to kinetochores and is recruited very early during NE assembly. Consistent with previous reports, GFP-Nup155 associated with the NE approximately 60 s after anaphase onset when the integral NE protein LEM-2 began to concentrate around chromosomes. Thus, MEL-28 is present on chromatin before NE reassembly and earlier than most other NE components."

Once transcriptionally activated, Plin-4::GFP-pest and Plet-7::GFP-pest reporters peak in expression by 1820 hours and diminish with similar kinetics. For animals expressing the Plet-7::GFP-pest reporter GFP-pest expression was monitored for longer periods after release from L1 arrest. Consistent with the highly pulsatile nature of this expression pattern, GFP-pest expression was reinitiated at 30 hours, which correlates with the later portions of the L2 stage. While transcriptional activation of the Pmir-1::GFP-pest reporter was also initiated at 14 hours post-L1 arrest, the peak of Pmir-1::GFPpest expression occurred at a later time point, and diminished with slower kinetics, as compared to Plin-4::GFP-pest and Plet- 7::GFP-pest expression.The majority of animals which harbor the Plin-4::GFP-pest transgene cease GFP-pest expression by L3 ecdysis and resume expression by the mid-L4 stage. The pulse of Plin-4::GFP-pest expression at the L4 stage extends through the early portion of young adulthood and completely overlaps with the lethargus period in all animals. Plet-7::GFP-pest expression followed a similar pattern. However, GFP-pest expression was more variable at the L3-to-L4 transition and L4-specific induction of this transgene was primarily restricted to the lethargus period. In contrast to the expression profiles of the lin-4 and let-7 reporters, induction of Pmir-1::GFP-pest expression began during, or immediately after, L3 ecdysis and persisted into the L4 stage. A second pulse of Pmir-1::GFP-pest expression completely overlapped with the L4 lethargus period and continued into early adulthood. Collectively, these results suggest that the expression patterns of lin-4, let-7 and mir-1 are dynamic throughout development and that the cyclical transcription of these miRNAs is mediated by their cognate promoter sequences."

This result differs from our northern blot data, which showed that miR-237 RNA was first detected at L2 (Expr3739). We believe that the mir-237::gfp expression at the L1 stage is accurate, and since mir-237 is only expressed in the Z1 and Z4 cells at this stage, miR-237 RNA is below the levels of detection by northern blot analysis. Once the Z1 and Z4 somatic gonad derivatives expand at L2, miR-237 RNA can be seen by northern blot. By the L3 stage, and persisting into the adult, mir-237 was expressed in the developing gonad, including the anchor cell, a subset of unidentified uterine cells, and the distal tip cells. The up-regulation of mir-237 expression in animals carrying the mir-237::gfp construct at the L3 stage in a variety of tissues, such as the gonad and the hypodermis, mirrors the increased miR-237 RNA levels observed at L3 by northern blot analysis. In addition, mir- 237 and mir- 84, were both expressed in the anchor cell and in the VPCs except P6.p at the mL3 stage. It is interesting to note that expression of mir-237, mir-84, and mir-48 was absent in the P6.p cell during the mid- to late L3 stage, and expression of mir-237 and mir-84 but not mir-48 was present in the anchor cell.",Anchor cell,Z4,Z1,seam cell,uterus,DTC,developing hermaphrodite gonad,vulval precursor cell

By contrast, we found that mom- 2 shows a restricted expression pattern, with mom-2 transcripts localizing only to the germ cell precursors Z2 and Z3, their descendants and a few unidentified cells in the tail. mom-2 expression in the germ cells continued throughout larval development, whereas the tail expression reached a maximum at the mid-L1 stage and disappeared before the L1 to L2 molt. In addition, one or two mom-2 transcripts were occasionally detected in posterior seam cells in early L1 larvae. Consistent with the early embryonic function of mom-2 (Thorpe et al., 1997), we found that mom-2 transcripts were already present in the zygote. At the four-cell stage, mom-2 transcripts were enriched in the P2 blastomere.

However, since the anti-MRG-1 antibody cross-reacts with an unknown protein of 55 kDa, it is not sure whether MRG-1 is a germline-specific protein. Therefore, the levels of MRG-1 was examined by Western blot analysis in three temperature-sensitive mutants with distinct deficiencies in germline development. These mutant animals show the following phenotypes at the restrictive temperature: in glp-4(bn2) animals, mitosis of PGCs is very slow because of the reduced function of glp-4, resulting in only ten to 20 mitotic germ cells and no meiotic cells in the gonad at the young adult stage. In fem-3(e2006) animals, the male sex-determination pathway is abolished because of the reduced function of fem-3, and only oocytes are produced. In fem-3(q20) animals, the male sex-determination pathway is constitutively activated because of the gain-of-function of fem-3, and only sperms are produced. MRG-1 was detected in all of the mutant adult hermaphrodites at the permissive temperature and also in fem-3(e2006) mutant hermaphrodites at the restrictive temperature at similar levels as in wild-type hermaphrodites. At the restrictive temperature, MRG-1 could not be detected in glp-4(bn2) mutant animals. In fem-3(q20) mutant animals at the restrictive temperature, the level of MRG-1 was significantly reduced.

WBGene00003582,dcap-2," Ding,  Spencer,  Morita, &  Han, 2005","The punctate cytoplasmic pattern of AIN-1::GFP resembles that of the P bodies. By using an anti-DCAP-2 antibody, DCAP-2 has been localized to cytoplasmic foci in C. elegans embryos that resembled P bodies (Richard Davis, personal communication). DCAP-2 is the mammalian and yeast homolog of subunit Dcp2 of decapping enzymes that localizes at P bodies. Staining using this antibody and an anti-GFP antibody indicated that AIN-1 was colocalized with DCAP-2 in the embryos. AIN-1::GFP was also observed to be colocalized with a FLAG-tagged DCAP-1 protein at cytoplasmic foci in C. elegans larvae. DCAP-1 is a homolog of mammalian and yeast Dcp1 that are also a subunit of decapping enzymes localized at P bodies."
WBGene00003582,dcap-2," Lall,  Piano, & Davis, 2005","Immunostaining of C. elegans embryos revealed that Dcp2 protein was found enriched in particles in the embryonic cytoplasm, and these particles disappear in embryos depleted of Dcp2 using RNAi. Dcp2 staining particles were on average 0.5 +/- 0.03 um in size, and many foci were observed per cell. Although it is difficult to count the exact number of foci in a given cell, the number of Dcp2 enriched bodies per cell more closely resembles the many particles observed in mammalian cells than the 2.4 +/- 1.4 foci per cell observed in yeast. Though present around nuclei in the germ cells of the gonad, cytoplasmic (nonperinuclear) Dcp2 foci were first obvious after fertilization and were present by the time the two pronuclei meet and fuse. By the 2-cell stage, Dcp2 bodies were observed throughout the cytoplasm of both the somatic and germ line lineage, though they often appear stronger in the P-cell than the somatic cell at this early point in development. From the 4-cell stage onward, many Dcp2 foci were observed in the cytoplasm of all cells. Dcp2 staining was faint in nuclei. Somatic CGH-1 foci are coincident with Dcp2. In contrast to previous observations showing that CGH-1 somatic foci disappear after the first few embryonic divisions, cytoplasmic Dcp2 foci persist throughout embryonic development. Dcp2 immunostained C. elegans embryos were colabeled with monoclonal antibodies that stain P-granules (K76 and OIC1D4) and also with anti-GLH-1, which has previously been shown to label P-granules. Such immunostaining indicates that Dcp2 is enriched in P-granules. Dcp2 is also present at sites where P-granules are observed in C. elegans germ cells during oogenesis."

WBGene00003738,nid-1,"Kang & Kramer, 2000","NID-1 was first detected in embryos at the beginning of morphogenesis (lima stage) localized to body wall muscle cells. As embryos elongate strong NID-1 staining is seen around body wall muscle cells and diffuse stain begins to accumulate on the surfaces of the pharyngeal and intestinal primordia. Once the embryo has elongated to the 2-fold stage, NID-1 has localized to the basal face of the body wall muscles and shows strong accumulation on the surfaces of the pharyngeal, intestinal, and gonad primordia. In three- and fourfold stage embryos, NID-1 accumulates to higher levels and remains localized under the four body wall muscle quadrants and on the surfaces of the pharynx, intestine, and gonad. In L1 larvae the intensity of staining of body wall muscle, pharynx, and intestine appears reduced, and strong staining associated with the nerve ring becomes apparent. This pattern continues through the L2 and L3 larval stages, with the addition of stronger staining of the distal tip cells as they lead the growth of the gonad. In late L3 to L4 stage larvae particularly strong NID-1 accumulation is seen associated with the distal tip cells and the developing somatic structures of the gonad, the spermatheca, uterus, and vulva. Under the body wall muscles of larval and adult stage animals NID-1 is organized as punctate lines. These lines follow the rows of dense bodies within the muscle cells. NID-1 also accumulates strongly at the outer edges of the muscle quadrants and more weakly at the boundaries between muscle cells within each quadrant. Less organized NID-1 staining is seen in the regions between the body wall muscle quadrants, presumably associated with the epidermal basement membranes in these regions. NID-1 accumulates along the four sublateral nerves that run beneath the center of each muscle quadrant. The sublateral nerves extend along dorso- and ventrolateral tracts from the nerve ring in the anterior of the animal to near the middle of the animal where they turn further lateral to positions coincident with the lateral edges of the body wall muscle quadrants. NID-1 accumulation on these nerves is seen in larval and adult animals and is similar in intensity to the staining at the edges of the body wall muscle quadrants. Staining along the edges of the body wall muscle quadrants appears to be associated with the muscle edges rather than the nerves in these regions because the staining closely follows the edge of the muscles and it does not display the left/right asymmetry expected for the ventral and dorsal nerve cords. Less organized NID-1 staining is also present in the regions between body wall muscle quadrants.",pharynx,gon_herm_dtc_P,gon_herm_dtc_A,gonad,spermatheca,intestine,body wall musculature,nerve ring,uterus,vulA,vulB1,vulB2,vulC,vulD,vulE,vulF
WBGene00003738,nid-1,"Ackley et al., 2003","At the light microscope level, it is not possible to determine whether NID-1 or CLE-1 is present within or excluded from synaptic clefts. However, these molecules are present at higher concentrations along the lateral region of the nerve cord, where synaptic junctions are abundant, relative to the medial region, which has many fewer synapses. The CLE-1 and NID-1 proteins appear to be present on different faces of the nerve cords relative to synaptic domains. NID-1 is present lateral to the region where synapses form, between the nerve cord and the muscle. CLE-1 is concentrated between the nerve cords and the pseudocoelomic space or overlying muscle arms, i.e., along the dorsal face of the ventral nerve cord and the ventral face of the dorsal nerve cord. Although CLE-1 and NID-1 are found overlapping or closely apposed to UNC-17 along the nerve cords, no consistent association of NID-1 or CLE-1 with UNC-17 puncta was observed, and vice versa. UNC-17 is not present at all of the presynaptic zones in the nerve cords. Similar distributions of CLE-1 and NID-1 relative to a marker for GABAergic presynaptic zones, juIs1, was observed. NID-1 and CLE-1 are also detected in nonsynaptic regions of the nerve cords, but generally at significantly lower levels."

WBGene00003777,nmy-2," Munro,  Nance, & Priess, 2004","As the embryo completes meiosis II, the sperm MTOC becomes visible in the posterior half of the embryo and moves into close association with the cortex. The sperm MTOC either appears and remains at the posterior pole or appears at an abaxial position before shifting to the posterior pole; this variation presumably reflects variation in the site of sperm entry. Regardless of its initial position, there was an immediate cessation in the formation of new NMY-2::GFP foci in the cortical region nearest the sperm MTOC. Existing foci and smaller filaments in this region moved rapidly and radially away from the sperm MTOC, generating a posterior zone devoid of foci and with a relatively smooth surface membrane. At the same time, foci throughout the cortex began to move toward the opposite, anterior pole at speeds up to 7.66 +/- 1.0 um/min (n = 6). Local clusters or chains of foci and interfoci continued their apparent contractions while moving collectively to the anterior, generating waves of surface invaginations previously described as ruffling. The general, anterior movement of foci was altered in the vicinity of pronounced surface contractions, where local foci moved transiently toward the contraction. The anterior flow generated a focus-rich anterior cap and a complementary posterior clear zone containing only small, dispersed filaments. Within the anterior cap, individual foci continued to coalesce, move and disappear with lifetimes similar to those seen in earlier embryos. Within the posterior clear zone, small filaments moved toward the anterior, and appeared to coalesce into new foci near the posterior rim of the anterior cap. This posterior rim eventually constricted about the circumference of the egg to form the pseudocleavage furrow. Thus a local change in the assembly/disassembly dynamics of NMY-2::GFP foci near the sperm MTOC, plus a continuous flow of NMY-2::GFP-containing structures away from the sperm MTOC, results in an enrichment of NMY-2::GFP at the anterior cortex."

Both F-actin and NMY-2 localize most densely to a cap covering the anterior half of the zygote, and a separate, less dense cap of actomyosin also is observed over the posterior pole. The lowest density of NMY-2 aggregates is consistently found in an intermediate zone that encircles the position of the NCC at the beginning of centration. Interestingly, the highest NMY-2 density is always found at the boundary between this intermediate zone and the anterior cap; until a late stage of centration, this myosin-dense ring is several micrometers anterior to the advancing NCC.  Although aggregates appeared to be highly mobile, the overall NMY-2 distribution pattern persisted past the end of centration."

As gastrulation begins, expression is seen in only Ca and Cp and then in their daughters, of which 2 are hypodermoblasts (Caa and Cpa) and 2 are myoblasts (Cap and Cpp). The GFP reporter is first detected at the late 2C-cell stage and then more strongly in the 4 daughters. At about 100 cells, expression is also detected in the 2 D-lineage myoblasts. Thereafter, PAL-1 continues to be detected in all C and D descendants until the end of gastrulation at about 350 cells. At about 180 cells (midgastrulation), the C hypodermal precursors, which express more strongly than the muscle precursors, form a characteristic double row on each side of the dorsal midline in the posterior. Thereafter, PAL-1 decreases in these cells and is no longer detectable with antibody after 350 500 cells. At about 250 cells, expression is detected in two AB cells that border the posterior left edge of the mesectodermal cell layer that is closing the ventral gastrulation cleft (ABplpappp and ABplppppp) and slightly later in the right homolog of one of them (ABprppppp). The daughters and granddaughters of these cells, generated after the cleft closes, continue to express strongly along the ventral midline until about the time of hatching. Beginning at about 360 cells, as morphogenesis begins, weak transient expression is detected in the posterior ectodermal P cells and occasionally in posterior V cells as both groups move ventrally. During this period the V cells become the lateral seam cells, and the P cells undergo their terminal embryonic divisions as they complete hypodermal enclosure of the embryo. Meanwhile, in the interior, pal-1 expression, detectable both with antibody and with reporter constructs, appears at about 350 cells in 2 Ea descendents near the middle of the gut primordium (the int5 pair) and in 2 anteriorly located MS descendants which migrate to the posterior and become the mesoblast M and the right intestinal muscle (mu intR).

Expression of the pha-1:lacZ hybrid gene at around 200 minutes of development is detected in about 25 cells that form a cylinder in the anterior part of the embryo. These pha-1:lacZ expressing cells are the pharyngeal precursors.

As soon as these 27 pharynx precursor cells divide (230-250 minutes), expression of the pha-1:lacZ gene in the pharyngeal precursors ceases and only a few cells in the presumptive pharynx region express the hybrid protein. At 420 minutes of development (2 fold stage) no pha-1:lacZ gene expression in the pharyngeal precursor cells is detectable. pha-1:lacZ expression was also observed in body wall muscle cell precursors.

However, in contrast to the P5.p lineage, POP-1 was most often localized in a low/high pattern after these divisions. For example, P7.pa most often had a lower nuclear level of POP-1 than its posterior sister P7.pp (21 of 25 specimens).

In summary, these studies show that POP-1 is typically localized in a high/low pattern in the anterior half of the vulva and in a low/high pattern in the posterior half of the vulva.

Within the neurons, PTP-3 partially overlapped the SNT-1-containing domain but was concentrated at the edges of the SNT-1 staining. There was a precise colocalization of PTP-3 with SYD-2 and UNC-10. More specifically, a smaller punctum of PTP-3 was observed in or near the center of each of the larger SYD-2 puncta. These data indicate that PTP-3 is predominantly associated with the presynaptic density. To address whether PTP-3 localization was dependent on synaptic vesicles, the accumulation of SNT-1, PTP-3, and UNC-10 were analyzed in unc-104(e1265) kinesin mutants, which causes synaptic vesicles to be retained in cell bodies. PTP-3 and UNC-10 puncta showed colocalization in regions of the nerve cord lacking synaptic vesicles. Thus, like other presynaptic density components, PTP-3 appears to be trafficked to synapses independent of synaptic vesicles."

Most of the PTP-3B::GFP was adjacent to the UNC-10 puncta, with only a small amount of GFP overlapping with UNC-10. PTP-3A::GFP expression was first detected around the 2-fold stage of embryonic development (450 min after fertilization) in the nerve ring and nerve cords and continued at a constant level through larval development. PTP-3A::GFP was seen in a punctate pattern along nerve processes and overlapped with UNC-10 in a pattern that was similar to the endogenous protein. These results suggest that PTP-3A is the major isoform that is localized to presynaptic domains. Consistent with this conclusion, in ptp-3A(ok244) mutant animals, <25% of the UNC-10 puncta (n = 200) contained any PTP-3, and the amount of PTP-3 present at those UNC-10 puncta was reduced."

Neurons of the head ganglion individually express comparatively low levels of pRIC-19::GFP in their cell bodies but, collectively, create a bright halo surrounding the pharynx. The earliest signs of expression are at approximately 450 min of development, when the pharynx primordium has already elongated and begun to form the two muscular bulbs. At this stage and until late in embryogenesis, expression of the pRIC-19::GFP reporter is present in one unidentified unbranched cell within the metacorpus. This cell may be MS.paapaap, the sister cell of M1 (M1 is the only other pharyngeal cell besides the M2's that expresses the pRIC-19::GFP reporter in the adult). Consistent with the disappearance of the GFP-positive cell in the metacorpus in late L1, MS.paapaap is a cell programmed to undergo apoptosis during development (Sulston et al., 1983). Other unique cells located in the metacorpus are the motor neuron M4, the interneuron I3, and the motor-interneuron MI. The three-fold stage is the earliest stage where the M2 axons can be unambiguously visualized using the pRIC-19::GFP reporter. At the three-fold stage, the motorneurons M1 also express considerable levels of the pRIC- 19::GFP reporter but during late embryogenesis and beyond the L1 larval stage, expression level remains high only in the M2 cell, fades away completely in the unidentified pharyngeal cell located in the metacorpus, and retains only weak expression in the cell M1.",m2R,m2L,M1 neuron,head ganglion

In early L2 zhIs5 larvae, the six VPCs expressed rom-1::nls::gfp at equal levels. The Pn.p cells that are not part of the vulval equivalence group and had fused to hyp7 at the end of the L1 stage showed relatively higher rom-1::nls::gfp expression than the VPCs (for example, P1.p, P2.p, and P9.p). Toward the end of the L2 stage, rom-1::nls::gfp expression decreased in distal VPCs adopting the 3N0 uninduced fate and persisted in the proximal VPCs adopting induced vulval fates.

The cortical staining was very weak, but this was most obvious at the cell-cell contact region where the two plasma membranes are attached. RPN-2 localises to the nucleus (but excluded from the chromosomes) during mitosis, but during interphase the signal for RPN-2 is very low. The nuclear accumulation of RPN-2 begins at prophase and increases in strength so that the nuclear signal is clearly stronger than the cytoplasmic signal at prometaphase. By metaphase, there is a strong accumulation on/around the mitotic spindle, but RPN-2 staining is excluded from both the chromosomes and centrosomes. The spindle remains positive for RPN-2 until early anaphase and gradually disappeared in the later stages of cell division. After cytokinesis, RPN-2 is once again detected in the cytoplasm and on the plasma and nuclear membranes, but very weak within the interphase nuclei at this four-cell stage.

At the 2-fold stage of embryogenesis, expression spread beyond the anterior cap of cells to other anteriorly located cells, including the most anterior head muscle cells and some anterior socket cells, a set of glia associated with head sensilla. During the second half of embryogenesis, when most cells and axons in the developing nervous system are migrating, slt-1::GFP expression was concentrated in anterior cells and excluded from the middle of the body. Expression in anterior cells, including the anterior hyp cells, continued throughout larval stages and in the adult.

WBGene00004855,sma-1,"McKeown,  Praitis, & Austin, 1998","sma-1 transcripts are present in the embryonic epidermis at the start of morphogenesis. In a population of mixed-stage embryos hybridized with a sma-1 antisense probe, sma-1 RNA was not observed in pre-morphogenesis embryos. In particular, there was no sign of sma-1 transcripts in early cleavage-stage embryos (2-8 cells). In embryos just beginning morphogenesis, sma-1 RNA was present in cells along the dorsal surface of the embryo, corresponding to the location of the epidermis at this point in development. Examining embryos at successive stages of morphogenesis, it was found that sma-1 RNA changed in a pattern that exactly matched the movements of the migrating epidermal cells. During early morphogenesis, when the epidermal cell sheet spreads over the lateral surfaces of the embryo, sma-1-expressing cells were observed on the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the embryo, but not on the ventral surface or in the head region, which at this stage are not yet covered by the spreading epidermis. In cross-section, it can be seen that the sma-1 RNA is located in the outermost cell layer of the embryo. As morphogenesis progresses, the spreading epidermis encloses first the ventral surface of the embryo and then the head as the embryo bends ventrally and begins to elongate. In embryos at this stage of morphogenesis, there was a corresponding pattern in which sma-1 RNA was seen first on the ventral surface and then on the anterior (head) surface of the embryo. At the same time, the overall level of sma-1 RNA rapidly decreased as the embryo began to elongate. sma-1 RNA in the epidermis was not observed in embryos past the 2-fold stage. In addition to sma-1 expression in the cells of the epidermis, a line of sma-1 RNA was observed in the interior of the embryo, oriented along the anterior-posterior axis. Based on its location, this sma-1 RNA seems located in the developing digestive tract of the embryo, consisting of the pharynx and intestine. During early morphogenesis, it is difficult to determine the anterior extent of sma-1 staining in the interior of the embryo, but as the embryo begins to elongate, the level of sma-1 RNA increases and at the 1.5-fold stage sma-1 RNA is clearly present in both the pharynx and intestine. A lower level of pharyngeal/intestinal RNA was observed in 2- to 3-fold stage embryos. In these older embryos, sma-1 RNA was also found in the excretory cell and in an unidentified cell near the anus. Expression of sma-1 RNA was observed in several epithelial tissues: epidermis, pharynx, intestine and excretory cell. sma-1 RNA was not seen in the body wall muscle cells, which are arranged in four stripes underlying the epidermis.
