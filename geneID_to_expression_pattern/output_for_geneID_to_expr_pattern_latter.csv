In epithelial tissues, alpha-spectrin is found at both the apical and basolateral regions of the membrane.

Prior to visible nuclear breakdown, the signal in the nucleus began to diminish, and there was a slight increase in cytoplasmic signal and a faint accumulation of signal around the centrosomes. As the spindle assembled, there was a diffuse staining on the spindle with a marked absence on chromosomes at the metaphase plate. SPD-1 underwent a rapid mobilization after the metaphase-anaphase transition. A bright signal appeared at the spindle midzone in a restricted region, similar to the region where other midzone components have been seen to localize. The signal around the centrosomes increased, and linear structures appeared in the cytoplasm. These structures were not as bright as the structures associated with the midzone microtubules. To determine whether these structures corresponded to microtubules, embryos were fixed and stained with GFP and tubulin antibodies and found that SPD-1::GFP colocalized to microtubules along a part of their length. These are probably bundles of anti-parallel microtubules. SPD-1::GFP began to accumulate in the nuclei as soon as these structures visibly reformed. As the furrow ingressed, the spindle midzone signal was compacted from individual bundles into one larger structure. This same pattern was observed in subsequent divisions, including EMS divisions. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised and purified against SPD-1 also localized to nuclei and the spindle midzone"
WBGene00004953,spd-2,"Kemp, Kopish,  Zipperlen,  Ahringer, & O'Connell, 2004","SPD-2 not only associates with centrosomes, but it does so at nearly all of the developmental stages examined. In the hermaphrodite gonad, SPD-2 localizes as discrete perinuclear foci in the mitotic portion of the germline. These foci were also evident during the early stages of oogenesis but were absent in mature oocytes. In contrast, mature sperm retained these SPD-2 foci with each male gamete containing a single dot adjacent to the nucleus. Similarly, in meiotic stage embryos, a single SPD-2-positive dot was observed next to the male pronucleus. In slightly older embryos, one or two perinuclear foci of SPD-2 staining were observed. The intensity of the foci increased with the age of the embryos and at mitosis both spindle poles were brightly stained. As embryos progressed through anaphase and telophase, the intensity of staining gradually diminished. Careful examination of the staining pattern at this stage revealed a diffuse area of SPD-2 material centered on one or two very bright dots. To determine if these central dots corresponded to the position of centrioles, SPD-2 distribution was examined in a strain expressing a GFP-tagged version of the centriole marker SAS-4 and it was found that the SPD-2 and SAS-4-positive dots coincided. SPD-2 probably localizes to both centrioles as well the pericentriolar region. Centrosome staining was also evident in older embryos and SPD-2-positive puncta were seen in young larvae, suggesting that SPD-2 is present at the centrosome throughout the entire life cycle. SPD-2 staining, however, was not restricted to the centrosome. Varying amounts of SPD-2 were also noticed present in the cytoplasm and nuclei of oocytes and embryos.",gonad

The size and intensity of these foci increased as the cell cycle progressed and peaked during mitosis. As in the case of fixed specimens, fluorescence intensity diminished by telophase, leaving behind two small brightly stained dots. These two dots persisted into the next cell cycle when once again fluorescence intensity gradually increased as the cells progressed toward mitosis. As with immunofluorescence, weak localization of SPD-2 were detected to nuclei."

Animals transgenic for either of these reporters expressed the fusion genes exclusively in the pharyngeal cells g1 and g2, the lateral seam cells, and the spermatheca. Expression was first visible in the seam cells of late embryos, where it persisted up to the fourth larval stage, but disappeared in adult animals. Expression in the glandular cells g1 and g2 started in L1 and remained visible until adulthood. In sexually mature hermaphrodites, expression was also observed in the spermatheca. In males, a similar pattern of expression was seen in g1, g2, and seam cells. In adult males, a strong expression signal was visible in the vas deferens.",spermatheca,vas deferens
